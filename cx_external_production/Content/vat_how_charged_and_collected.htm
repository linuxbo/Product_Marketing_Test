                <MadCap:concept term="Value Added Tax (VAT)" />How VAT is Charged and Collected</h1>
            <p>VAT is charged and collected in several countries worldwide. The rules about when to register, what to charge, how to collect, what to file with the government, and so on, vary from country to country. </p>
            <p>The information in this document about VAT is meant to serve as a summary reference only. We recommend you visit the "HM Revenue and Customs" Web site at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a> for current information about VAT in the EU.</p>
            <h2>VAT Registration</h2>
            <p>As a general rule, anyone that sells goods and services over the registration threshold (see <a class="Heading_And_Page MCXref xref xrefHeading_And_Page" xrefformat="{b}{para}{/b}" data-mc-unresolved-link="import-link:terminology_1453209499_35116"><span class="zCrossReference">Value Added Tax (VAT) Terminology</span></a> for definitions of VAT-related terms) for a country must register for VAT in that country. Registration in one country does not preclude registration in another country. </p>
            <p>Businesses and sellers can apply for a registration exemption if the value (taxable turnover, or sales) of the taxable supplies does not exceed the specified limit for the country, or if most or all of the taxable supplies are zero-rated. </p>
            <p>Digital River is registered for VAT in several countries inside and outside the EU, and will act as the Seller of Title (SOT) for clients. If a client wants to act as the SOT they must register for VAT themselves. However, most clients elect to use Digital River as the SOT to simplify the process. Digital River will then register, collect, and remit VAT tax paid on orders placed with that client. </p>
            <h2>Reduced Rate and Zero-Rated Supplies</h2>
            <p>Depending on the country and taxable supplies sold, a reduced rate or zero-rate (0%) VAT may be used. </p>
            <p>Reduced rate supplies are simply taxable goods and services that have a lower percentage VAT rate than the standard VAT rate. The percentage varies by country, and in some cases, by item being taxed. In the UK, the reduced rate is 5% (at the time of this printing) for goods and services such as domestic fuel or power, renovations or alterations of dwellings, women’s sanitary products, and children’s car seats. </p>
            <p>Zero-rated supplies are taxable goods and services that currently have a 0% VAT rate. In the EU, some examples include most foods, newspapers and books, children’s clothing and shoes, public transportation services, and exports. </p>
            <h2>Exemptions</h2>
            <p>Some goods and services do not require VAT to be charged and these are called "exempt supplies." Exempt supplies are different than zero-rated taxable supplies even though no VAT is charged on either. The difference lies in the purchasers ability to reclaim VAT paid on materials used to make any exempt supplies they sell, or on services that are exempt. </p>
            <p>When a shopper goes through checkout on your store and the order contains taxable supplies, text fields will appear where the shopper can enter their company information and VAT registration number. When the registration is verified, the VAT is removed from the order. </p>
