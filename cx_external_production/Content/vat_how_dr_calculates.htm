                <MadCap:concept term="Value Added Tax (VAT)" />How Digital River Calculates VAT</h1>
            <p>This topic outlines how VAT is calculated, charged, and invoiced on Digital River stores. Digital River has implemented a third-party tax solution to calculate and charge VAT on orders with taxable supplies. </p>
            <p>In most cases, Digital River is the Seller of Title (SOT) for orders where VAT is charged. This is because most clients use Digital River’s taxing profile, which contains Digital River’s VAT registrations. </p>
            <p>Tax calculations are done using Digital River as the SOT unless the site/store is specifically set up to use a different taxing profile. The system automatically calculates and charges the appropriate tax for purchases based on several factors: </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Product Tax Code</li>
                <li value="2">Merchant Nexus (Location)</li>
                <li value="3">Shopper Ship-To Location</li>
                <li value="4">Ship-From Location </li>
                <li value="5">Other Merchant Registrations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On many Digital River stores, VAT rates are initially displayed to shoppers using the locale chosen by the shopper on the store. For these sites/stores, the VAT displayed on the store and the VAT charged when the order is completed may differ, depending on the situation. </p>
            <p>When a shopper enters their billing and shipping information upon checkout on these stores, the VAT is recalculated to show the rate appropriate for their actual location. For physical products, the shopper’s shipping address may be used to determine the VAT rate. For downloaded products, the shopper’s IP address and/or billing address may be used to determine location and the appropriate VAT rate to use. </p>
            <h2>Estimated VAT vs. VAT Inclusive Pricing</h2>
            <p>When you set pricing for products requiring VAT, there are two basic pricing models you can follow: VAT inclusive pricing or estimated VAT pricing. </p>
            <p>Depending on your needs and where the tax is being charged and collected, you may choose to set product prices with VAT included or use the estimated VAT pricing model. Some jurisdictions (for example, the EU) require pricing to be set with VAT included so you should contact the appropriate tax authority before deciding on a final pricing method. </p>
            <p>The main difference between VAT inclusive and estimated VAT pricing is the shopper experience. These two pricing models are explained more below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Estimated VAT Pricing</b> – Prices are set with VAT excluded. The shopper is given an estimation of VAT, based on the locale they are viewing. The store has a disclaimer stating that the VAT is estimated at this point. When the shopper enters the billing and shipping addresses for the order, the VAT is calculated and shown on the order summary page before the final purchase is made. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="nested_p">With estimated VAT pricing, the shopper experience suffers slightly as they do not always see the exact price they will pay for a product (with VAT) when they add the product to the cart and begin the checkout process. The exact price is shown before final order confirmation is made but the estimated VAT is shown in the interim. As a client with this pricing model you always receive the same revenue share (margin) per product sold. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>VAT Inclusive Pricing</b> – Prices are set with VAT included. The shopper is shown the product price with VAT included. When the purchase is complete, the VAT is listed on the invoice for the order. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="nested_p">With VAT inclusive pricing, the shopper experience remains unchanged as they see the exact product price (with VAT) at the time they add the product to the cart and during checkout. However, as a client you may not always receive the same revenue share (margin) for each product sold as the VAT is controlled by the price list for the store and may differ slightly </p>
            <p>If you are unsure whether you should set pricing with or without VAT included, ask yourself which of the following is most important to you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Do you want the shopper to always see the exact price for a product when VAT is required? If yes, you should use VAT Inclusive pricing. </li>
                <li value="2">Do you want to always receive the same revenue share per product sold and spend less time managing your product pricing? If yes, that you should use Estimated VAT pricing. </li>
            </ul>
