                <MadCap:concept term="Offers" />How Conflicting Offers are Treated</h1>
            <p>Now that you know what affects an offer on your store, you can better understand what happens when two or more offers can be redeemed within the same order. This section explains how offers are reconciled against one another, and provides some real-world examples to help explain this process.</p>
            <h3>Running Multiple Offers</h3>
            <p>Because there is no limit to the number of offers you can create (and no limit on how many offers can be created for a single product) a conflict can occur when two or more offers can be applied to an order. For this reason, it is sometimes puzzling to determine which offer will be applied to which order and when, or how multiple offers with similar discounts are treated. </p>
            <p>Conflicts between offers can happen when two or more offers for the same product, or two or more different offers for different products are triggered. When this conflict occurs, the system uses a sophisticated set of rules and guidelines to arbitrate offer conflicts, and provide your shoppers with the best discount.</p>
            <h3>Offer Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Offer arbitration refers to the process that occurs when two or more competing offers (that is, offers that could be applied to an order because the offer conditions have been met in the shopping cart) are analyzed so that only the best discount(s) is given. </p>
            <p>When a store has multiple offers, the offer(s) that provide the best discount to the shopper are always used. This is true regardless of the individual options set for the offer, including the type of offer and how it is triggered on the store. </p>
            <p>When the shopper begins checkout, the system analyzes the contents of the shopping cart to determine which offer(s) give the best discount for the order. </p>
            <p>Offers arbitration occurs each time the order pricing is recalculated, with the winning offer being applied until arbitration occurs again (at which time another offer may win arbitration). Order pricing is always recalculated when one of the following occurs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Change in product quantity</b>. Most offers are tied in some way to product quantity, so when the quantity of product(s) in the shopping cart changes the contents are reevaluated to determine which offer is the best discount. This is especially important with tiered discount offers.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Addition or removal of products</b>. Nearly all offers are affected by what product is being purchased. When products are added or removed from the shopping cart, the shopping cart is reevaluated to determine if an offer should be applied. This is especially important with bundle offers because they require specific products be purchased.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Change to shipping or billing address</b>. Offers can require a specific ship-to address so if the address is changed, the order is reevaluated to determine if it is still eligible for the offer. </li>
                <li value="4"><b>Change in store locale</b>. Offers can be set up for specific locales only, so changing the locale may activate or deactivate an offer for the order. </li>
                <li value="5"><b>Change in currency</b>. Some offers can be set up for specific currencies. If the currency is changed, it may make the order ineligible for the offer. </li>
                <li value="6"><b>Change in shipping method</b>. Shipping offers can require a specific shipping method to be chosen. If the method is changed in the shopping cart, it can make the order ineligible for the offer and the discount will be removed. </li>
                <li value="7"><b>Restored shopping cart</b>. Visitors and shopping carts are tracked by cookies. If a shopper leaves a store without completing an order, the contents of the shopping cart are saved in a cookie for up to one (1) year from the date when the shopping cart was opened. When a visitor returns to the store and re-opens the shopping cart, it is restored to its last version saved in the cookie. If offers were applied to the order, they are re-arbitrated using current offer data, which may affect the discounts being seen.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because offers are arbitrated each time the pricing on the order is calculated, the offer that is applied to an order before and after one of the above named actions may change. </p>
            <p>For example, a shopper in London (locale en_GB) enters a store and leaves the default locale United States (en_US) selected. The shopper browses the store and adds a product to the shopping cart. In the shopping cart they see a discount of $5 off the product price of $50. The shopper changes the selected locale to United Kingdom (en_GB) and the discount is no longer applied to the order. </p>
            <p>The example above occurs because the offer was only valid for shoppers in the United States (en_US) locale, or for orders shipped to that locale. If the store had another offer that was set up for the United Kingdom (en_GB) locale, it would have been applied to the order when the locale change was made.</p>
            <h3>Arbitration by Discount Level</h3>
            <p>Marketing offers provide discounts on one of the following levels: </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Order Level Discount</b> – Discounts the total costs for an order. </li>
                <li value="2"><b>Item Level Discount</b> – Discounts costs associated with a single line item (product).</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Order Level Shipping Discount</b> – Discounts shipping costs for an entire order.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>Product Level Shipping Discount</b> – Discounts shipping costs for a specific product in the order.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The discount level is determined by the Offer Type and other options set up for the offer. During offer arbitration, offers are only reconciled against other offers with the same discount level. The offer(s) with the largest value off per discount level win arbitration. This means that under the right circumstances, a shopper can have up to four offer discounts being applied their order.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have a order level discount offer (10% off orders totaling $100 or more) and a product level discount (5% off product price), both offers can be applied to an order because each discounts a different level. Offer arbitration does not happen between offers of different discount levels. </p>
            <h3>Other Considerations in Arbitration</h3>
            <p>When the system calculates the possible offers for an order and arbitrates the winner, other options can affect which offer is applied (or appears to be applied) to the order. </p>
            <h4>Offer Trigger</h4>
            <p>Offers that are always available to shoppers are automatically applied to qualifying orders. If an offer was created to be always available and an end date was not set for the offer, it may still be running on the store and may conflict with new offers.</p>
            <p>Offers that use coupon codes require the shopper to enter a code in the shopping cart to redeem the offer on the order. If the shopper does not enter a code, the offer is not applied to the order. Coupon codes remain applied to an order until another offer (offer arbitration) or a change in the shopping cart overrides this. </p>
            <h4>Browser Cookies</h4>
            <p>Outdated browser cookies can also affect offer arbitration. By default, all shopping carts hosted by Digital River use a cookie to track visitors and shopping cart contents. Cookies expire one (1) year after they are created (that is, when the first product was added to the shopping cart). When a visitor/shopper returns to a store and opens the shopping cart, it may show discounts arbitrated in the previous visit. </p>
            <p>Digital River recommends that if an offer does not appear as expected, the browser cookies are deleted to make sure that an old cookie is not affecting the offer arbitration. Also, don’t forget that each browser uses its own cookie, so if you use more than one browser you may need to delete cookies in more than one place. </p>
            <p>Outdated cookies affecting arbitration is a situation common with someone who repeatedly tests offers on a store. Users who regularly previews offers (without using the "Test Live Site" or "Test Design Site" links/functions) may see unexpected results because the cookie from their previous session is being used to arbitrate offers in the shopping cart.</p>
            <h3>Redeeming Multiple (Stacked) Offers</h3>
            <p>A "stacked" offer occurs when a shopper redeems two or more offers in the same order. In general, offers provide four distinct types of discounts. A shopper can redeem a stacked offer as long as there is only one offer for each of the following discount types in the order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Product-specific discount (a discount on product cost for a specific product)</li>
                <li value="2">Store-wide discount (a discount on product cost for any product)</li>
                <li value="3">Product-specific shipping discount (a discount on shipping costs for a specific product)</li>
                <li value="4">Store-wide shipping discount (a discount on shipping cost for any product)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if you create an offer to provide a store-wide shipping discount of 10% and an offer to give a product-level discount of 25%, a shopper could redeem both offers because one is a store-wide shipping discount and the other is a product-specific cost discount. If both offers were product-specific shipping discounts, the shopper could only use one in the order (the system chooses the best deal for the shopper and applies that offer to the order).</p>
