            <p>You can control which product sellers can see your product in the marketStream Common Catalog. This limits who can add the product to their catalog and sell it on their site. You choose which companies participating in the marketStream program (see <a href="ms_intersite_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About marketStream Channel Intersite</b></a> for more about the program) that you want to see the product, thus hiding it from everyone else.</p>
            <p class="note_error"><b>Warning</b>: Until you set seller visibility for a product, all sellers in the marketStream program can see the product and sell it on their site. If you have set visibility for one or more sellers you must remove this visibility to have all sellers see your product again. See <a href="#allowingallsellers" class="selected">Allowing All Sellers to See the Product</a> below for more information.</p>
            <p>When you allow a specific seller to see a product, they can see it in the marketStream Products list and add it to their catalog to sell it on their site. Any seller that you have not explicitly allowed to see your product will not be able to see it in the marketStream Products list. The product will not appear in the marketStream Products list for that seller and they will not be able to see it on their site.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: If you remove visibility for a product from a seller that has already added your product to their catalog, an email is sent to the email address on record for that company notifying them of the change and that the product will be removed from their catalog. The product is removed from the product seller's catalog in three (3) days to allow any outstanding transactions to complete. </p>

                <li value="4">In the new window that opened, enter criteria about the company you want to find in the fields provided and click <b>Search</b>. This is the marketStream Program seller you want to be able to see the product in the Common Catalog. </li>

                <li value="6">Repeat steps 3-5 for every seller/company that you want to be able to see or sell your product.

            <h2><a name="allowingallsellers"></a>Allowing All Sellers to See the Product</h2>
            <p>Until you set seller visibility for a product, all sellers in the marketStream program can see the product and sell it on their site. This means that once you perform the steps above, some sellers who once could see your product will find the product removed from their catalog after the three day grace period. </p>
            <p>You can allow all sellers to see the product in the Common Catalog by removing all sellers/companies from the list of those allowed to see the product.&#160;This resets the product to the default state where it is visible to all sellers in the marketStream Common Catalog.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">To allow all sellers to see your product in the Common Catalog:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">On the <i>Set marketStream Visibility</i> page, select all the sellers in the list and click <b>Remove</b>. Make sure you select all sellers or the visibility restrictions will still be in place for the product.<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/marketstream_visibility4.gif" /></li>
