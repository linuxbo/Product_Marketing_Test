                <MadCap:concept term="Locales;Localizing" />About Store Locales</h1>
            <p>Every store has one default locale. The default locale is the locale your store is set up to use by default, that is when no other locale has been selected. </p>
            <p>Most often the default locale is the locale where a company is located or where most of its shoppers live. For example, a store that services customers mainly in the Unites States would have a default locale of "en_US" (English, United States) because most shoppers will be from that locale. Any additional locales set up for your site that are not the default then become "supported" or "unsupported" locales for your store. </p>
            <h2>Supported and Unsupported Locales</h2>
            <p>A supported locale is one that you have chosen to use on your store to provide a localized experience to shoppers in that locale. Supported locales allow you to offer shoppers a tailored shopping experience for their language and currency. You can have as many supported locales as you want but unless you create localized content for those supported locales they won’t do much to give the shopper a familiar or comfortable experience. </p>
            <p>An unsupported locale is any other locale that is not your default locale or a supported locale on your store. Shoppers in unsupported locales are still able to view and shop your store, they just won’t see content in their native language, currency, and so on. Instead, they see your store in the default locale.</p>
            <h3>How Supported Locales Work</h3>
            <p>The supported locales for your store are defined when your store is created. How a shopper can choose to view a supported locale varies by your store design. Some stores try to automatically detect a shopper’s locale while others provide shoppers with some mechanism to choose the locale they want to view. </p>
            <p>The most common mechanism used to provide shoppers a way to select a supported locale is a language, country, currency, or flag selector. With this mechanism, the shopper chooses the language/country/currency/flag that represents their locale or the locale they want to view. Regardless of how a shopper selects a locale on your store it is important to remember that Digital River must enable all supported locales on your store before you can create localized content for these locales.</p>
            <p>The following examples show a country selector and a currency selector that a shopper could use to select their locale and see the store content in their language or currency. </p>

            </p>
            <h3>Shoppers in Unsupported Locales</h3>
            <p>Whether a locale is or is not supported by your store does not affect a shopper’s ability to view or make a purchase on your store. Shoppers in unsupported locales can visit your store and make a purchase but the product content and other store elements will appear as they would for the default locale.</p>
