            <h2>Fee Management Tool</h2>
            <p>Digital River’s Fee Management solution streamlines the administration and management of fees, reporting, reconciliation and remittance obligations; making compliance as easy as possible. The following is a high-level overview of the Digital River Fee Management Tool is used to manage fees:</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">System Fee is created (and then deployed) by Digital River Fee Manager. </li>
                <li value="2">System Fee is used (by Fee Manager, Client, or Account Manager) to create a Company Fee.</li>
                <li value="3">Product is enabled to use fees (either individually or using the bulk tool).</li>
                <li value="4">Company Fee is attached to product (either individually or using the bulk tool).</li>
                <li value="5">Product is deployed and fee begins charging on the site.</li>
                <li value="6">Fee pricing and setup is continually managed and updated as need arises.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Flexible Fee Configuration</h4>
            <p>Our Fee Management Tool comes loaded with a set of system-level fees already created and configured by our tax department. Using these fees as templates, you can create specific fees for your company in compliance with your store requirements and product line. Starting from a pre-defined system fee to create your company fees means you can be sure that the fee configuration meets the current requirements for compliance. This also means that as laws change the fee behaviors can be updated to reflect these changes.</p>
            <p>System and Company Fees are made up of several components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Custom Attributes</b> – Defines specific qualities applied to a fee, individual product, or classification. Custom attributes can be values such as the speed of a printer or copier, or the capacity of a blank CD or DVD. </li>
                <li value="2"><b>Classification</b> – Defines the types of products for which a fee will be charged. Classifications can have categories and sub-categories as needed.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Jurisdiction</b> – Defines the country in which the fee will be charged. Each jurisdiction can have only one country associated with it, and each country cannot be used by more than one jurisdiction. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Product and Fee Association</h4>
            <p>Once company fees are created you can enable a product to use fees and associate specific fees to those products. Fees are enabled and associated with products using the Product Editor (or the bulk tool, as explained below) in the Command Console. You choose the fee you want to associate with the product and the system does the rest. Once you deploy a product with a fee, most of the fee setup (attributes, classifications, and jurisdictions) is locked and cannot be changed.</p>
            <h4>Bulk Fee Import and Export</h4>
            <p>We built a bulk feature for fees for those clients that need to associate fees with many products at once. Using an Import and Export spreadsheet that is similar to the ones you use for other bulk catalog tasks, you can associate fees with many products as once, thus reducing the amount of time it take to get your store in fee compliance.</p>
            <h4>Reporting</h4>
            <p>Compliance schemes require a variety of reporting and fee remittance standards that vary by product, country, and fee type, and are an essential step toward total compliance. Digital River has a complete set of reports that meet both internal business management and external compliance requirements. The reports contain not only the essential data to satisfy compliance scheme reporting standards, but also an overview of fee collections and refunds to simplify the management of cash flow and accounts payable. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Sales and Activity Reports</b> – Includes data required to meet the reporting standards of each recycling and copyright compliance scheme in the participating countries across Europe.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Accounting Reports</b> – Facilitates the tracking and reconciliation of ensuring a more transparent accounting process.</li>
            </ul>
