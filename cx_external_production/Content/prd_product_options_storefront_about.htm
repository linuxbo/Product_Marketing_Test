                <MadCap:concept term="Products Options;Storefront Settings;Products" />About Storefront Settings</h1>
            <p>The Storefront Settings are used to enter details about the product, including names and other information that will appear when the product is seen on your store. Storefront Settings are the core attributes for your product and entered for every product regardless of other settings or options you have chosen to enable.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: To save time when creating a product with variations, you should enter as much of the Storefront Settings for the base product as you can before you create any variations. This is because when you create a variation, the Storefront Settings will automatically copied to the variation.</p>
            <h2>Storefront Settings and Shopper Searches</h2>
            <p>When a shopper searches your store, the following Storefront Settings attributes are searched for the terms they enter: Site Product Name, Short Description, Long Description, and Keywords.</p>
            <h2>Product Names and SKU</h2>
            <p>There are two names that are entered for products in the Storefront Settings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The "Internal Product Name" is the name used to identify the product in reports, offers, and other places within the Command Console. </li>
                <li value="2">The "Site Product Name" is the name seen by shoppers when they are browsing your store. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note_note_indent"><b>Tip</b>: When a shopper searches your store, the Site Product Name is searched for the terms they enter.</p>
            <p>Both names are required and you can use special letters, numbers, and most character characters is each of the names.</p>
            <p>The SKU, or Stock Keeping Unit, is a code of letters, numbers, and symbols that uniquely identifies the product to your company. The SKU may appear to shoppers on your store or used in reporting.</p>
            <h2>Tax Category</h2>
            <p>Depending on where in the world your products will be sold you may need to assign a Tax Category so that taxes can be accurately calculated and charged. If you are unsure which category you should assign to your products, consult a tax professional as they can help you determine which code should be used for your products.</p>
            <p>When a product is purchased on your store the taxes are automatically calculated based on the type of product, the shopper’s shipping address, where the product is sold from, the product weight, and the Tax Category assigned to the product in the Command Console. </p>
            <p>The list of tax categories you can assign are the most commonly used categories. You can set which category is selected by default using the Product Template (see <a href="prd_product_template_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About the Product Template</b></a> for more information). If you need a tax category that is not in the list, contact your Store Operations team.</p>
            <h2>Return Type</h2>
            <p>When a shopper wishes to return a product, you can require the shopper to physically return the product to you or allow the shopper to complete a Electronic Letter of Destruction (ELOD) that certifies they have destroyed any copies of the product and will not continue to use the product upon return.</p>
            <h2>Store Details</h2>
            <p>The Store Details area a collection of attributes that are used when the product is seen on your store by shoppers. The include the names, images, and descriptions of the product.</p>
            <h3>Product Descriptions and Keywords</h3>
            <p>You can enter two different product descriptions that describe the features, benefits, and so on for your product and use HTML tags to customize how those descriptions appear when they are seen on your store. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The "Short Description" appears in areas of your store where the product is seen among a group or list of other products, such as with search results or an offer that shows "top" or "featured" products. </li>
                <li value="2">The "Long Description" appears on the Product Details page and may appear in other areas if your store has been customized.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also enter "Keywords" that help define your product and include words or phrases shoppers might enter to find the product on your store. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: When a shopper searches your store, the Short Description, Long Description, and Keywords are searched for the terms they enter.</p>
            <h3>Product Images</h3>
            <p>Images are an important visual element to your products because shoppers will see these images when they browse products or see the product listed on a Category Listing page, Product Detail page, or within an offer. </p>
            <p>There are two different images you can set up for your product: the "Product Image" and "Thumbnail." </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The "Product Image" appears on the Product Detail page and may appear in other areas if your store has been customized.</li>
                <li value="2">The "Thumbnail" appears in areas of your store where the product is seen among a group or list of other products, such as with search results or an offer that shows "top" or "featured" products.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The images you use for the product images should be high-quality images that represent the product to your shoppers. Mist of the time the images are pictures of the product but they can also other images such as the product logo, company logo, and so on. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: We recommend that when you save images for use with products that you use words like "standard" and "thumbnail" in the file name to help you easily identify the images once they have been uploaded to the Command Console. Images that are uploaded for products are saved in a central location so it can be difficult to identify or locate a specific image. Organizing or naming your images in a meaningful way will save you time when working with your products. </p>
            <h3>Additional Order Confirmation Email and Thank You Page Text</h3>
            <p>You can enter additional text that you want to appear in the Order Confirmation email sent to shoppers when their order is submitted. The text you enter appears in the email after the default text that already appears in the email. The text you enter for a specific product preceded with the Site Display Name so for orders with multiple products shoppers can identify what text is for what products. </p>
            <p>When you enter additional text for the Order Confirmation email, you can enter different content for both the text&#8209;based and HTML-based email. Keep in mind that your store may not be set up to send HTML-based emails to shoppers. Contact your Store Operations team to learn if your store sends HTML-based emails or how you can get them enabled for your store.</p>
            <p>In addition to the text you can add to the Order Confirmation email, you can enter text that you want to appear on the Thank You page that a shopper sees when they submit an order on your store. The text you enter appears after the default text that already appears on this page. </p>
            <h3>Minimum and Maximum Purchase Limits</h3>
            <p>You can set purchase quantity limits on any product on your store. Purchase quantities are enforced on a per order basis and shoppers may return to your store later to make another purchase within the specified limits. </p>
            <p>The Minimum Quantity attribute is used to specify the minimum number of a product a shopper must purchase. The Maximum Quantity attribute is used to specify the maximum number of a product a shopper can purchase. </p>
            <p>By default, the minimum and maximum quantities are set to "0" which means there are no purchase quantity limits. </p>
