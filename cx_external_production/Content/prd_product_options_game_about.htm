                <MadCap:concept term="Game;Products Options;Products" />About the Game Setting</h1>
            <p>The Game setting is used to set game ratings and reasons for those ratings for computer games, console games, and so on. </p>
            <h2>About Game Ratings and Reasons</h2>
            <p>Sellers of video and computer games are encouraged to use game rating systems and assign ratings to any game products they sell on their store. If you use a particular rating system you should be aware that most rating systems have standards for how and when that system's ratings can and should be used. Not complying with these standards can sometimes result in fines. In some cases ratings systems are sponsored by the government and in some countries using a game rating system is the law (for example, Australia). </p>
            <h3>Where Ratings Appear</h3>
            <p>Most rating systems require that the ratings appear to shoppers before they complete their purchase. The game ratings and game reasons you define will appear on the Product Detail pages and in the Shopping Cart. Ratings and reasons may also appear in other places on your store if your store has been customized to show them (however this is usually not required by the rating system).</p>
            <h3>Compilation or Bundle Ratings</h3>
            <p>If you want to sell one or more games together, you can provide a compilation or "bundle" ESRB&#160;game rating. There are several different combinations of ratings such as "Teen to Mature" or "Early Childhood to Teen" and so on. Compilation game ratings appear on the store similarly to single ratings (in the Shopping Cart or on Product Detail pages). For more about creating a game product that uses a compilation rating, see </p>
            <h2>Game Rating Organizations</h2>
            <p>There are several different game and entertainment rating organizations throughout the world that provide publishers and sellers a consistent way to rate games and other entertainment products such as movies and software. </p>
            <p>You can provide ratings using classifications from several different entities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/" target="_blank">BBFC</a> (British Board of Film Classification) – Previously known as <i>British Board of Film Censors</i>.</li>
                <li value="2">CERO (<span style="font-weight: normal;">特定非営利活動法人コンピュータエンターテインメントレーティング機構)</span> – A Japanese rating system. Also called <i>Computer Entertainment Rating Organization</i>. </li>
                <li value="3">ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) – A United States and Canada rating system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note_note_indent"><b>Note</b>: In addition to the standard ESRB ratings, the Command Console also has several "combination" ESRB ratings that can be used with game bundles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><a href="http://www.pegi.info/" target="_blank">PEGI</a> (Pan European Game Information) – A European rating system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note_note_indent"><b>Note</b>: The PEGI&#160;game rating entity has different rules for how games should be rated depending on where they are sold. Games sold in Portugal must use different ratings than those sold anywhere else in the world. The PEGI ratings in the Command Console include ratings for both Portugal and the rest of the world. Make sure you use the correct rating based on where your game will be sold.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">USK (Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle) – Also referred to as <i>German Self-Monitoring of Entertainment Software</i>.</li>
                <li value="2">Classificação – The term used in the Command Console to refer to the <i>Department of Justice, Rating, Titles and Qualification (DJCTQ)</i> Brazil rating system. In Portuguese it is called <i>Departamento de Justiça, Classificação, Títulos e Qualificação</i>.</li>
            </ul>
