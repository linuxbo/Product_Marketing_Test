            <p>The <i>Fulfillment Acknowledgement</i> &#160;page is used to perform several different fulfillment-related tasks for physical orders. This includes marking an order (or item) as shipped, indicating an error happened with a product or order, putting items on backorder, and so on.</p>
            <h2>Opening the Fulfillment Acknowledgement Page</h2>
            <p>All of fulfillment tasks you can do for a physical order are done on the <i>Fulfillment Acknowledgement</i> page. </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">To open the Fulfillment Acknowledgement page:                 &#160;</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">On the <b>Customer Service</b> menu, select <b>Fulfillment</b>, and click <b>Fulfillment Acknowledgement</b>. The <i>Fulfillment Acknowledgement - Order Search</i> page appears.</li>
                <li value="2">Use the controls in the <b>Search and Filters</b> area to define and search for the order you want to perform fulfillment tasks for. </li>
                <li value="3">Once you get search results, click the <b>Order Number</b> for the order you want to view and/or take action upon. When you click an order number, the <i>Fulfillment Acknowledgement - Order Details</i> page appears. It is on this page that you perform fulfillment tasks for the order. Use the instructions below to learn how to ship items, cancel items, put items on backorder, mark items with errors, and so on. </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Tasks You&#160;Can Perform on Orders</h2>
            <p>Once you are viewing an order, there are several different tasks you can do depending on the order itself. You can take the same action against all items in an order or take different actions on individual items in the order, however the process is mostly the same regardless of how many items you are taking action against.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: For a summary of what you see on the <i>Fulfillment Acknowledge</i> page and how the fields and options are used, see <a href="cs_fulfillment_acknowledgement_defined.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About the Fulfillment Acknowledgement - Order Details Page</b></a>. </p>
            <p>The following outlines the tasks you can perform on an order. Information about how to perform all these tasks in included in the instructions below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Indicate that all items in the order have shipped, or are on backorder, or have errors, or should be canceled.</li>
                <li value="2">Indicate one or more items in the order have been shipped.</li>
                <li value="3">Indicate one or more items in the order are on backorder.</li>
                <li value="4">Cancel one or more items in the order. </li>
                <li value="5">Mark one or more items in the order as having a fulfillment error (missing part number, incorrect address, and so on).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Taking Fulfillment Action on Orders</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">To take fulfillment action on an order:</p>
            <table class="TableStyle-for_dropdowntext" style="mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/for_dropdowntext.css');margin-left: 0px;margin-right: auto;margin-top: -5px;margin-bottom: -5px;" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr class="Body-Body1">
                        <td class="BodyA-Column1-Body1" style="background-color: #c1e4ff;"><b>Role Needed</b>: <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open">Physical Fulfillment Manager<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A user role that provides access to the Fulfillment Acknowledgement page.

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">First, use the instructions above to locate the order you want to take action against. Then, while viewing the order on the <a href="cs_fulfillment_acknowledgement_defined.htm">Fulfillment Acknowledgement - Order Details</a> page, scroll down to the <b>Quick Submit</b> area (on the <b>Process Order</b> tab).<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/fulfillment_acknowledgement9_780x200.jpg" style="width: 780;height: 200;" /></li>
                <li value="2">From the <b>Mark All Line Items</b> list, select the action you want to take against one or more items in the order. The action you take does not have to be for all items in the order, it can be just for some items in the order. <br /><br />If you have more than one action to take on an order (ship, backorder, cancel, mark as error) you will have to do each action separately. In a later step you will indicate exactly which items you are acting upon in your current task before saving. <br /><br />We recommend you do your ship actions first, then backorder and cancel, and finally error.<ul><li value="1">Select <b>Shipped</b> if you are shipping items in the order. </li><li value="2">Select <b>Cancelled</b> if you are canceling items in the order.</li><li value="3"><a name="error-code"></a>Select <b>Error</b> if there is an item with an error in the order. When you select this option, the <b>Error Reason</b> list appears so you can select the reason for the error. It is very important that you select the correct <b>Error Reason</b>. <br /><br />If items in the order have different errors (for example, one item has an incorrect SKU or part number and one item has a bad shipping address) you must process those errors separately so you can select the right error code for each item. If you do not select the right error code for an item, it will make it very difficult to fix the error and complete the fulfillment for the order.</li><li value="4">Select <b>Backordered</b> if items in the order are on backorder.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="3">Now, in the <b>Packages</b> area (above the <b>Quick Submit</b> area), from the <b>Number of Packages</b> list, select the number of packages you will ship today. If you are not shipping products, just select "1" because if you are putting items on backorder, canceling items, or making items with errors, you do this one at a time and the actual package number does not count. The number of packages may have already been selected if previous items in the order have been acted upon. </li>
                <li value="4">If you are subcontracting the actual fulfillment to an outside company or group, from the <b>Fulfillment Center</b> list, select who did the fulfillment for the order.</li>
                <li value="5">In the <b>Package X Quantity</b> field(s), indicate the quantity of each item that you are taking action against. A different <b>Package X Quantity</b> field appears for each number of packages you selected above. If you are putting items on backorder or marking items with errors, you still need to enter the quantity of the product that you are taking those actions against for one of the packages (if does not necessarily matter in which package you indicate items are on backorder or should be canceled or have errors). <br /><br /><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCToggler MCTogglerHead MCTogglerHotSpot MCToggler_Open toggler MCTogglerHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" data-mc-targets="2"><img class="MCToggler_Image_Icon" src="../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />Click here to see an example of what you would enter if you were only shipping one  item</a>. <br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/fulfillment_acknowledgement4.jpg" style="display: none;" data-mc-target-name="2" /><br /></li>
                <li value="6">In the <b>Ship Date</b> field, enter the date when you will ship the package(s), even if that date is not today.</li>
                <li value="7"><b>If you are shipping items</b>: For the packages you are shipping, (note the "<b>Package X</b>" column for each package in the order) enter a <b>Tracking Number</b>, select a <b>Shipping Carrier</b>, enter a <b>Shipping Cost</b>, and enter any <b>Packing Slip Notes</b> as needed. <br /><br /><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCToggler MCTogglerHead MCTogglerHotSpot MCToggler_Open toggler MCTogglerHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" data-mc-targets="1"><img class="MCToggler_Image_Icon" src="../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />Click here to see an example of what you would enter if you were shipping three items in three different packages</a>. <br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/fulfillment_acknowledgement3.jpg" style="display: none;" data-mc-target-name="1" /></li>
                <li value="8"><a name="backorder"></a><b>If you are putting items on backorder</b>: For the packages with items on backorder, enter the quantity of the product that is backordered in the <b>Package X Quantity</b> field that appears on each line with products in the order. Make sure you enter the quantity in the field for the right product (you can identify a product using the <b>Part Number</b> listed).</li>
                <li value="9"><a name="errors"></a><b>If you are indicating items have errors</b>: For the items with errors, indicate the quantity of the product with the error (most likely all quantities of any one part number) in the <b>Package X Quantity</b> field that appears on each line with products in the order. It is very important that all the items you are acting upon have the same error. If items have different errors you must process each error separately. See the information in step 2 about indicating items have errors and selecting the appropriate error codes. Also, make sure you enter the right quantity in the field for the right product (you can identify a product using the <b>Part Number</b> listed).<br /></li>
                <li value="10"><a name="cancel"></a><b>If you are canceling items</b>: For the items you want to cancel, in the <b>Package X Quantity</b> field, enter the quantity of the product you are canceling. You can cancel some of all the quantity of a particular product. Make sure you enter the quantity in the field for the right product (you can identify a product using the <b>Part Number</b> listed).</li>
                <li value="11">When you are done taking the current action on the product, click <b>Save</b>. If you have additional actions you need to take against items in the order, repeat these steps as needed.</li>
