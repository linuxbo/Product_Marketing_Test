                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers Bundles" />About Bundle Offers</h1>
            <p>Some product offers are known as "bundle" offers. A bundle offer is one where the products in the offer have a relationship (see <a href="#ParentChild" class="MCXref xref selected"><b>Parent and Child Products</b></a> below) and the discount is given when the bundled products are purchased together. </p>
            <p>There are many types of bundle offers you can create, depending on how you want the offer to behave. To learn more about the specific types of bundle offers you can create, see <a href="mr_about_product_offers.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Product Offers</b></a>.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Revenue Tip</b>: If your store sells digital products and uses the <a href="eds_about_eds.htm">Extended Download Service (EDS)</a> we recommend you create bundle offers for your digital products and use EDS as the "child" product. Our tests have shown that shoppers are more likely to purchase EDS when it is automatically added to the shopping cart via a bundle offer. Keep in mind that offers do not have to provide a discount, so a bundle offer can be used to simply add a product to the shopping cart. Be aware that shoppers can only add <u>one</u> bundle with EDS&#160;to their cart in a single order because EDS&#160;itself can never exist more than once in a shopping cart regardless of how it is added (either as a standalone product or as part of a bundle). <br /></p>
            <h2><a name="ParentChild"></a>Parent and Child Products</h2>
            <p>In a bundle offer, the product that initiates the offer (the one the shopper adds to the shopping cart) is called the "parent" product. The product that is offered to the shopper or added to the shopping cart  when the parent product is added is called the "child" product. Shoppers must add a parent product to the shopping cart first in order for a bundle offer to be triggered. </p>
            <p>All bundle offers (with the exceptions noted below) must have at least one parent product and one child product and those products should never be the same product. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The "all products bundle" offer type uses every product in the default catalog for the site as the parent product so you are only required to select the child product.</li>
                <li value="2">The "custom bundle" offer type does not have traditional parent and child products like other bundle offers. Instead, you create groups of products from which shoppers can choose and the groups or products do not have a relationship to each other as they do with other bundle offers. To learn more about custom bundle offers, see <a href="mr_about_bundle_offers_custom_bundles.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Custom&#160;Bundles</b></a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you create a bundle offer you define how you want the parent and child product(s) to behave in relation to each other. For example, what happens if the quantity of the parent product is changed in the shopping cart?&#160;Does the child product's quantity change in relation to the parent or is it not affected by the parent product? See <a href="mr_about_bundle_policy.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Bundle Policy</b></a> to learn more about the relationship between parent and child products in bundles.</p>
            <h3>How the Order in which Products are Added to the Cart Affects Bundles</h3>
            <p>In order to trigger a bundle, a shopper must add the parent product to the shopping cart first. If a shopper adds a child product to the shopping cart the bundle offer will not be triggered for the order.</p>
            <h3>Purchasing Parent or Child Products in Addition to a Bundle</h3>
            <p>If a shopper wants to purchase a parent and/or child product in addition to the bundle for which those products belong, one of the following must be true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Site has "allow duplicate line items" enabled (to learn more about the duplicate line items setting, contact your Store Operations team). When the duplicate line items setting is enabled for a site shoppers can purchase two of the same bundle, or purchase a parent and/or child product in addition to a bundle that also contains those products. </li>
                <li value="2"><a href="mr_about_bundle_policy.htm">Bundle policy</a> is set to "tight" or "tight with independent child quantity" and the shopper adds a child product to the shopping cart before they add the parent product to trigger the bundle.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Purchasing Two Bundles at Once</h3>
            <p>Shoppers can purchase two bundle at once, even if those bundles share a parent and/or child product. Sites do not need the "allow duplicate line items" setting to be enabled for a shopper to be able to purchase two bundles even if those bundles have shared products.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;If a store does not have the "allow duplicate line items" setting enabled for a site, and a shopper adds a bundle with the "tight" policy to the shopping cart and then adds a bundle with the "semi-tight" policy that contains a product from the tight bundle, only the non-shared products in the semi-tight bundle will be added to the cart. For example, bundle #1 (the tight bundle)&#160;has products A and B. Bundle #2 (the semi-tight bundle) has products B and C. When the shopper attempts to add bundle #2 to the cart, only product C will be added because it already exists in the cart from bundle #1.</p>
            <h2>Bundle Offers and Points of Promotion (POPs)</h2>
            <p>Most bundle offers do not require a point of promotion (POP) to be used on your store, however you may want to use a banner POP or interstitial POP to promote the offer. The only bundle offer that requires a POP&#160;is the "custom bundle" type and it requires the "CustomBundle_Eligibility_Promotion" POP.</p>
