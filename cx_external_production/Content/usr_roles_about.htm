                <MadCap:concept term="Users;Roles" />About User Roles</h1>
            <p>When a user logs on to the Command Console, the menu items they see and the features they can use vary based on the company and site(s) they have access to and the roles they have been assigned for each. To learn how to assign roles to a user, see <a href="usr_create_edit_user.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating and Editing Users</b></a>.</p>
            <h3>Companies and Sites</h3>
            <p>Your "company" is the highest level of structure and organization for your Command Console account and online store. A company owns one or more sites (stores), with each site having its own catalog of products. Your user profile controls which companies and sites you have access to, and defines which roles you should have for each. </p>
            <p>Companies can have subordinate companies, which in turn also have sites with catalogs and products, however most accounts are set up with only a single company. If you are given access to a company, you also have access to any subordinate companies within the parent company. Some features, such as reporting, may require you to login using separate log in credentials to access data about subordinate companies). </p>
            <h4>Company Roles vs. Site Roles</h4>
            <p>Roles define what parts of the Command Console a user can access and what they can do with certain features and functionality. The concept of roles and controlling what menu commands can be seen or what features can be used is also called security rights, security access, or access rights.</p>
            <p>There are two types of roles: company and site. Each type controls different levels of access in the  Command Console.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Company Roles</b> – Controls access for company-level features such as Reporting and User Management. The company roles you are assigned will be the same for each site/store that is created for the company.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Site Roles</b> – Controls access for site-level features such as Site Pulse and Marketing. The site roles you are assigned are specific only to the site/store for which they were designated. Users with access to multiple sites/stores can have different roles on each.</li>
            </ul>
