                <MadCap:concept term="Extended Download Service (EDS)" />About EDS&#160;(Extended Download Service)</h1>
            <p>Extended Download Service, or EDS, is an effective way to increase average order value (AOV) on your store. EDS is a service that you offer your shoppers for their digital or download purchases. EDS allows your shoppers to download their product again if something happens to their initial download (or computer)&#160;and increases the amount of time after purchase in which they can download their product(s)/purchase.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;To use EDS&#160;on your store, contact your CMM. Additional site design work is needed to get EDS&#160;set up and running on your store. </p>
            <p>EDS&#160;is highly customizable and will operate on your store according to your unique setup. However, there are some things that are the same for EDS regardless of how it has been set up for your store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">EDS appears in the shopping cart as an additional option shoppers can add to their cart and purchase for their digital and download products. Some stores use the all products bundle offer to automatically have EDS added to the shopping cart when a digital or download product is added. </li>
                <li value="2">EDS&#160;is sold on a per-product basis and is available for all digital and download products sold on your store and in your catalog.</li>
                <li value="3">Shoppers can purchase EDS for some or all of the digital and download products in the order. They do not have to purchase EDS for any products, nor do they have to purchase it for every product. Regardless of how many products EDS&#160;is purchased for, it will only exist once in the shopping cart (EDS&#160;itself cannot exist more than once in a shopping cart) because it is a service and not a physical product.</li>
                <li value="4">EDS increases the timeframe in which shoppers can download their purchase. Without EDS, most sites have a 30-60 day window after purchase date where shoppers can download their purchase. EDS&#160;usually extends this period of time to one or two full years after the purchase date. However your store can choose any period of time you want.</li>
                <li value="5">EDS&#160;can be purchased with the order or after the initial order is placed. The timeframe in which shoppers can purchase EDS&#160;after their initial order varies and is related to the "refund timeframe" set for your store. The refund timeframe is the amount of time after an order (digital or not) a shopper can request a refund.</li>
                <li value="6">Pricing for EDS&#160;is set within the default price list for your site. To vary the price of EDS by the product being purchased, you can use marketing offers to discount the price based on the product or category of the product.</li>
            </ul>
