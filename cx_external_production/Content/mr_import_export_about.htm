                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers Import and Export" />About Import and Export Offers</h1>
            <p>The Import and Export Offers feature is used to create or edit offers en masse. With the Import and Export Offers feature you can use spreadsheets to create new offers or make changes to existing offers. You can also use the Import and Export feature to upload images used with your offers and interstitial (cross-sell/up-sell) pages. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: The Import and Export tool cannot be used to create or edit any type of shipping offer, category offer, or shopper-defined bundles. You can only create or edit these type of offers using the Command Console.</p>
            <h2>Creating Offers with Import and Export</h2>
            <p>If you want to create offers with the Import and Export feature you must first export a blank spreadsheet, or if preferred, a spreadsheet that contains some offer data so you can see how the offer attributes are defined in the spreadsheet. The cells of the spreadsheet are where you enter or change the attributes/settings for an offer. Once you are done defining your offers, you simply import and spreadsheet and your offers are created. </p>
            <h2>Editing Offers with Import and Export</h2>
            <p>If you want to edit your offers using Import and Export, you must export the offers you want to change. When you export offers they are saved in a spreadsheet that you can then edit and import back into the system. The cells of the spreadsheet are where you enter or change the attributes/settings for an offer. </p>
            <h3>Exporting Offers</h3>
            <p>There are many ways you can define what offers you want to export. You can choose which offers to export by the offer ID(s), product ID(s), or date range(s) for the offer. You can also choose how you want Parent and Child products to appear in the spreadsheet when you export. Keep in mind that because you cannot use the tool with shipping offers, those types of offers will not be exported.</p>
            <h2>Importing Changed Spreadsheets</h2>
            <p>After you are done working with an exported spreadsheet (either a blank template or one with existing offer data) you will want to import that spreadsheet so the changes are made to your offers. Keep in mind that unless you change the status in the spreadsheet, all imported offers are given the "Open" status and must be deployed before the changes are seen on your store. </p>
            <h3>Warnings and Errors</h3>
            <p>When you import a spreadsheet, you may see messages listed at the top of the page about warnings or errors with the data (for example, a required cell was not completed, or a cell contains the wrong type of value). A copy of these warnings and errors will also be emailed to you for reference. You must fix all errors before the import will be processed. Offers with warnings will be imported but we recommend you fix any warnings before you deploy the offers to your store. </p>
            <h3>Importing Images</h3>
            <p>You can use the Import and Export tool to import a Zip (.zip) file of images you want to use with offers. This can save you time because importing a Zip file of images take less time than importing each image separately.</p>
            <p>All the images imported to Marketing are saved in a common place, so you don’t have to worry about whether an image will be available for an offer once it is imported. Make sure the Zip file name and the names of the images in the Zip file do not contain spaces or special characters. Also, the Zip file should only contain JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg), GIF (.gif), or bitmap (.bmp) image files.</p>
            <p>When the Zip file is imported, the images will be saved in a folder with the same name as the Zip file. If there are folders within the Zip file they will also be imported.</p>
