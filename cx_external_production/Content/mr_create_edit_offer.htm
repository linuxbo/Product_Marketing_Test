                <MadCap:concept term="Offers" />Creating Marketing Offers</h1>
            <p>Marketing offers are promotions or discounts used to entice shoppers to purchase products from your site. There are many types of offers you can create  including bundled offers that tie two or more products together. See <a href="mr_offers_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Marketing Offers</b></a> for more about the types of offers you can create.</p>
            <p>The steps to create different types of offers are similar. Editing an offer is similar to creating one, except you do not use the Offer Wizard and instead edit the parts of the offer separately. </p>
            <p>The specific steps you take to create an offer will vary, based on the type of offer you are creating and the additional options you want to enable or use with the offer. The steps below provide a summary of the steps and link to other topics in this file that explain what to do or select in those steps in more detail.</p>
            <h2>Opening the Offer Wizard</h2>

            <ol>
                <li value="1">Before you can create an offer, you should know how you want the offer to behave. See <a href="mr_before_you_create_an_offer.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Things to Consider Before Creating an Offer</b></a> for more information.</li>
                <li value="2">On the <b>Marketing</b> menu, select <b>Offers and Programs</b>, and click <b>Create Offer</b>. </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>First Step of the Offer Wizard (Type)</h2>
            <p>The <i>Type</i> step is where you enter basic information about the offer and choose the type and trigger.</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">Enter the basics for the offer (Name, Description,&#160;External Reference ID). Keep in mind that neither names or descriptions are seen by shoppers on your store.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note_note_indent"><b>Note</b>:&#160;In order for the External Reference Offer ID&#160;to work, the Command Console must be set up to communicate with whatever third party system you use to track offer usage. When an order is placed from an offer that has an external reference ID, the Command Console will send the external reference offer ID&#160;to whatever system has been integrated to receive it.<br /><br />Please note that reports in the Command Console will not contain metrics about usage of offers by the external reference ID. Also, no validation is done to ensure that every external reference offer ID&#160;is unique and not used by any other offer for your site. </p>
            <ol data-mc-continue="true">
                <li value="2">In the <i>Expiration</i> area, select whether you want the offer to begin and/or end on a particular date. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" data-mc-continue="true"><li value="1">Select the <b>Start
 Date</b> check box if you want the offer to begin on a certain date (the offer must be deployed prior to this date for the offer to become live on that date) and then define the start date for the offer. </li><li value="2">Select the <b>End Date</b> check box if you want the offer to end on a certain date and then define the end date for the offer. If you set an end date, the offer will automatically become "<a href="mr_about_offer_status.htm">expired</a>" when it reaches this date.</li></ol></li>
                <li value="3">In the <i>Type</i> area, choose the offer type. The offer type determines how the offer behaves on your store and the types of discounts and products it can provide. You will notice that as you select a type, the selections in the <i>Trigger</i> area below it become available or unavailable depending on the type you choose. <ul data-mc-continue="true"><li class="disc" value="1">See <a href="mr_create_choosing_offer_type.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Choosing the Offer Type</b></a> for more about the type of offer you should create depending on what you want the offer to do. </li><li class="disc" value="2">If the type you want to create isn't listed it means it has not been configured to appear as an option for your site (see <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Configuring Offer Types</b></a> for more information). </li><li class="disc" value="3">This topic explains how to create offers in general, but you can learn more about creating specific types of offers with      <a href="mr_create_offer_coupon_code.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Coupon Code Offers</b></a>, <a href="mr_create_offer_custom_bundle.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Custom&#160;Bundle Offers</b></a>, and Creating Shipping Offers.</li></ul></li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note_note_indent"><b>Note</b>:&#160;Once you complete the offer wizard and save an offer you cannot change the type. </p>
            <ol data-mc-continue="true">
                <li value="4">In the <i>Trigger</i> area, choose the offer trigger. Depending on the offer type you selected you may not be able to select some triggers. See <a href="mr_create_choosing_offer_trigger.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Choosing the Offer Trigger</b></a> for more about the types of triggers and see <a href="mr_create_choosing_offer_type.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Choosing the Offer Type</b></a> to learn which triggers are available with each offer type. </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Second Step of the Offer Wizard (Behavior)</h2>
            <p>The <i>Behavior</i> step is where you define how you want the offer to behave on your store. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;What you see in this step will differ based on the type of offer you are creating and the trigger you selected. </p>
            <p>Use the information and links below to help you define the settings you see on the screen. Settings are listed below in alphabetical order but the order in which they appear on your screen will differ.</p>
            <h3>Bundle Options</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings7_648x219.jpg" style="width: 648;height: 219;" />
            </p>
            <p> If you selected an offer type that is a bundle (with the exception of the custom bundle type) this area appears so you can define the relationship between the products in the bundle. Select the options that represent how you want the parent and child products to behave in the offer. See <a href="mr_about_bundle_policy.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Bundle Policy</b></a> for more about the options you can select and how it will affect the offer behavior.<br /></p>
            <h3>Coupon Codes</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings3_637x123.jpg" style="width: 637;height: 123;" />
            </p>
            <p>If you selected the coupon code offer type, an area will appear for you to indicate how you want to get coupon codes for your offer. Select how you want to add coupon codes to the offer. Once you complete the wizard you will be able to add, generate, or import the codes for the offer. See <a href="mr_create_offer_coupon_code.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Coupon Code Offers</b></a> to learn more about the options you have for adding coupon codes to your offer, and how to add them after you have completed the wizard.today <br /></p>
            <h3><a name="DiscountLevel"></a>Discount Level</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings2_640x122.jpg" style="width: 640;height: 122;" />
            </p>
            <p>This area will either have options you can select or show the discount level for the offer type you have selected. Two of the following three possible options will appear: </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="disc" value="1"><b>Product(s) (Line Item)</b> – Discount is applied to each individual product associated with the offer, however all products must use the same type of discount (percent off, amount off, etc.).</li>
                <li class="disc" value="2"><b>Order</b> – Discount is applied to the total of the order if the order meets the requirements for the offer.</li>
                <li class="disc" value="3"><b>Bundle</b> – Discount is applied to the total for the bundle. Other products in the order that are not part of the bundle will not be discounted.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a name="OfferControls"></a>Offer Controls</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings1_643x195.jpg" style="width: 643;height: 195;" />
            </p>
            <p>These settings are used to control how many times an offer can be used, what locales can see and redeem the offer, and who can redeem the offer (public shoppers vs purchase plan shoppers). See <a href="mr_about_usage_controls.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Usage Controls</b></a> to learn how to control how many time the offer can be redeemed. See <a href="mr_about_locale_restrictions.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Locale Restrictions</b></a> to learn how to control what locales can see or redeem the offer.  <br /></p>
            <h3>Offer Display</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings4_644x209.jpg" style="width: 644;height: 209;" />
            </p>
            <p>This area is where the POPs that have been associated with the offer type you selected will appear. A POP&#160;determines where and how  the offer appears on your store. If you want to use a POP&#160;with the offer, select the POP&#160;from the list. If the POP&#160;you want to use isn't listed, it means it hasn't been added to the offer type in the <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm">offer settings</a>.  </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: Keep in mind that some offers require a specific POP&#160;to be selected or the offer will not appear or work as expected. See <a href="mr_about_offer_types.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Offer Types</b></a> to learn if the offer type you selected requires a specific POP. </p>
            <p>When you select a POP, the <i>Supported Locales</i> area will appear at the bottom of the page so you can choose the locales can see the POP&#160;(and therefore the offer). If you want to control what locales can see the offer but are not using a POP, use the setting in the <a href="#OfferControls" class="selected">Offer Controls</a>.<br /></p>
            <h3>Offer Tracking</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings5_644x94.jpg" style="width: 644;height: 94;" />
            </p>
            <p>This setting is used to indicate how you will be distributing the offer to shoppers and is used to track the offer performance in the <a href="dsh_merchandising_dashboard_view.htm">Merchandising Dashboard</a>. Select how you will distribute the offer and track it on the dashboard.<br /></p>
            <h3>Shipping Discount</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings8_643x185.jpg" style="width: 643;height: 185;" />
            </p>
            <p>If you are creating an offer of the "discount" type you can optionally set a shipping discount that will apply to the offer in addition to any other discount you define. The types of shipping discounts you can provide are the same as the types of shipping discount offers you can create. See <a href="mr_about_shipping_offers.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Shipping Offers</b></a> for more information.<br /></p>
            <h3>Subscription Controls</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings6_648x130.jpg" style="width: 648;height: 130;" />
            </p>
            <p>These settings are used to indicate how the offer should behave if subscription products are part of the offer. This area appears for every offer. If you do not associate subscription products with the offer, these settings will be ignored.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Apply to Initial Purchase</b> – Offers with subscription products can be used if it is the first (initial) purchase of the subscription by the shopper.  </li>
                <li value="2"><b>Apply to&#160;Manual Review</b> – Offers can be applied to orders where the shopper is manually renewing their subscription, if the offer has been created and deployed for the subscription product that needs to be renewed.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Apply to Auto Renew</b> – Offers can be applied to automatic renewal orders, if the offer has been created and deployed for the subscription product that is being renewed. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Third Step of the Offer Wizard (Products and Pricing)</h2>
            <p>The <i>Products and Pricing</i> step is where you associate products to an offer and define the discount (if any). Use the information below to help you set up the products and pricing for your offer.</p>
            <p>What you see on the Products and Pricing step will vary depending on the offer type you selected and the discount level you selected in the previous step. If you are creating a custom bundle offer, the Products and Pricing step will be very different. See <a href="mr_create_offer_custom_bundle.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Custom&#160;Bundle Offers</b></a> for more information.</p>
            <h3>Pricing Information</h3>
            <p>The <i>Pricing Information</i> setting is where you choose the currency you want to be used for the offer. This is the currency that will be used to calculate the discount (if the offer provides one) and convert that discount into other currencies. We recommend you select the currency that is the default for the price list used by the products you will add to the offer.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings11_687x97.jpg" style="width: 687;height: 97;" />
            </p>
            <h3>Product Eligibility</h3>
            <p>The <i>Product Eligibility</i> area is where you define which products a shopper must purchase to be eligible to redeem the offer. The option you select here will determine what appears next on the page. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings10_689x143.jpg" style="width: 689;height: 143;" />
            </p>
            <h4>Non-Bundle Options</h4>
            <p>The information below lists the options that may appear for non-bundle offers depending on the eligibility option you selected.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Specific Products – Select this option if you want to choose products a shopper must purchase in order to redeem this offer. If you select this option, the <i>Products</i> area appears where you can select the products you want to add to the offer and indicate whether you want to provide a discount for the products and whether the discount should be the same for all products or vary from product to product. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCToggler MCTogglerHead MCTogglerHotSpot MCToggler_Open toggler MCTogglerHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" data-mc-targets="1"><img class="MCToggler_Image_Icon" src="../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />See example</a>.<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings12_628x384.jpg" style="width: 628;height: 384;display: none;" data-mc-target-name="1" /></li>
                <li value="2">Specific&#160;Categories – Select this option is you want to use a category of products as the eligible products. If the shopper purchases any of the products in any of the categories you add, they will be eligible for the offer. This option makes it easy to add many products to your offer at once. If you select this option, the <i>Categories</i> area appears where you can add the categories of products you want to be used for eligibility and indicate whether you want to provide a discount for the products in the categories. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCToggler MCTogglerHead MCTogglerHotSpot MCToggler_Open toggler MCTogglerHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" data-mc-targets="2"><img class="MCToggler_Image_Icon" src="../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />See example</a>. <br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings13_633x364.jpg" style="width: 633;height: 364;display: none;" data-mc-target-name="2" /></li>
                <li value="3">All Products Except Excluded Products – Select this option if you want every product in your catalog to be an eligible product, except for the ones you add to the Excluded Products list (you do not have to exclude products if you want every product in your catalog to be eligible for the offer). When you select this option, the <i>Excluded Products</i> area appears where you add those products that you do not want to be used to determine eligibility for the offer and indicate how you want to discount the products in those categories you do want to use for eligibility and indicate how you want to discount the products you do want to use for eligibility. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCToggler MCTogglerHead MCTogglerHotSpot MCToggler_Open toggler MCTogglerHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" data-mc-targets="3"><img class="MCToggler_Image_Icon" src="../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />See example</a>.<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/offers_create_settings14_633x374.jpg" style="width: 633;height: 374;display: none;" data-mc-target-name="3" /></li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Bundle Options</h4>
            <p>When you are creating a bundle offer, the areas that appear where you add products are different to allow for parent products and child products (see <a href="mr_about_bundle_policy.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Bundle Policy</b></a> to learn more about parent and child products in a bundle offer. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: The information in this area does not apply to custom bundle offers. See <a href="mr_create_offer_custom_bundle.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Custom&#160;Bundle Offers</b></a> for more about creating custom bundle offers.</p>
            <p>The information below lists the options that may appear for non-custom bundle offers depending on the eligibility option you selected.</p>
            <ul>

                <li class="disc" value="2">If creating a coupon code offer, an option appears at the bottom of the <i>Review</i> page for you to indicate if you want to add coupon codes to the offer now. Make your selection for this option.</li>
                <li value="2" class="disc">When you are satisfied with the offer setup, click <b>Finish</b> to complete the offer.
