                <MadCap:concept term="marketStream Intersite" />How the Intersite Program Works</h1>
            <p>The Intersite program exists to provide a way for Digital River clients to sell each other’s products on their stores, and earn money on those sales. </p>
            <p>When you enroll in the Intersite program, you choose whether you want to sell other people’s products on your store and/or allow other people to sell your products on their store. The role you take depends on what you want to gain from the program. You are not required to sell other’s products and allow your products to be sold, however most Intersite participants do a little bit of both.</p>
            <p>Once you sign up to participate in the Intersite program and the legal agreements for your participation have been accepted, you will be able to browse and choose products from the Intersite Catalog to sell on your store. You will also be able to add your own products to the Intersite Catalog so that other Intersite participants can sell your products on their store. </p>
            <p>A brief summary of the process and steps involved in the Intersite program are given below. Please note that when you see the word "you" it means not only you personally, but someone else in your company that also has an approved role in the program. See the additional information about specific parts of this process.</p>
            <h2>Summary of the Intersite Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">You sign up for the program and choose what role(s) you want play and how you will participate in the program. This is done by contacting your Store Operations team or Digital River and requesting information about how to enroll in the Intersite program.</li>
                <li value="2">You accept the legal agreements for the program through the Command Console. For more information, see <a href="ms_intersite_who_does_what.htm#Legal" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Legal Agreements Approver</b></a>.</li>
                <li value="3">(Optional) You add your products to the Intersite Catalog and define how your products should appear and be priced when sold on another store. You also define how you want to approve that a product can be sold by other sellers, as well as manage any custom pricing by seller. Once a product is added to the Intersite Catalog, it becomes available to other Product Sellers to sell on their store and you may have to approve those sellers before sales on their store can occur. For more information, see <a href="ms_intersite_add_products_to_catalog.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Adding Your Products to the Intersite Catalog</b></a>.</li>
                <li value="4">(Optional) You browse the Intersite Catalog to find products that you want to sell on your store and add them to your catalog on your store. When you search the Intersite Catalog, you can locate products based on the category in the Intersite Catalog they have been added to, as well as search by pricing and Product Seller. You can also create rules that automatically add products in the Intersite Catalog to your catalog, based on certain characteristics. For more about selecting products from the Intersite Catalog to sell on your store, see <a href="ms_intersite_select_products.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Selecting Products from the Intersite Catalog</b></a>.</li>
                <li value="5">Products are sold on the store and payment for an Intersite sale is received by the seller, while a cut of that sale is shared with the owner of the product. Because the Intersite program is managed with the Command Console, you do not have to do anything to get or give payment for Intersite sales of your products or on your store. Digital River will automatically submit payments to Product Owners and Product Sellers as needed.</li>
