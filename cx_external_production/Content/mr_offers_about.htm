                <MadCap:concept term="Offers" />About Marketing Offers</h1>
            <p>A marketing offer is a promotion or discount used to entice shoppers to purchase from your store. Most offers  provide a discount on the price of a product or shipping costs, but you can create an offer that promotes certain products or encourages shoppers to purchase additional products.</p>
            <p>There are many things that influence how an offer appears and behaves on your store. The settings you choose for your offer determines the type of discount or promotion the offer takes, how long the offer is available, how an offer is redeemed by shoppers, what locales the offer supports, how many times an offer can be redeemed, where the offer appears on your store, and so on.</p>
            <h2>Types of Offers</h2>
            <p>There are many types of offers you can create and each type has specific options and settings that define how the offer works and it's specific purpose.  For example, the "cross-sell" offer type is used to entice shoppers to buy an additional product when another product is added to the shopping cart. </p>
            <p>The specific type of offer you choose to create dictates how you set up the offer and the product(s) that can be associated with the offer. In some cases, the offer type determines what can be discounted and how the discount is applied. For more about offer types, see <a href="mr_about_offer_types.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Offer Types</b></a>.</p>
            <p>When you create an offer, the offer types that are available are determined by the offers you have set up to be used by your site. If an offer type isn't available when you create an offer, it most likely means that the offer type has not been configured for your site.  See <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Configuring Offer Types</b></a> for more information about how you can define which offer types can be used on your store.</p>
            <h3>Product and Shipping Offers</h3>
            <p>Offers can be separated into two larger categories: </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Product Offers</b> – Created to discount or promote specific products. See <a href="mr_about_product_offers.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Product Offers</b></a> for more information.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Shipping Offers</b> – Created to provide shipping discounts on orders. See <a href="mr_about_shipping_offers.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Shipping Offers</b></a> for more information.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Bundle Offers</h3>
            <p>There is a specific type of product offer you can create called a "bundle" offer. Bundle offers are offers where two or more products have a relationship (also known as the bundle policy). The bundle policy determines whether adding or removing one product in the shopping cart affects another product in the shopping cart or presents the shopper with additional product choices. For more about bundle offers, see <a href="mr_about_bundle_offers.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Bundle Offers</b></a>.</p>
            <h2>What Offer Type Controls</h2>
            <p>The following is a summary of what the offer type controls. More information about each of these is provided in a later section.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The products in the offer. You can create an offer for:<ul><li class="disc" value="1">One or more products (you can search for the products you want, or enter product IDs).</li><li class="disc" value="2">All products in a catalog or category (works only with "individual products," that is products without variations).</li><li class="disc" value="3">All products in a catalog or category except those you specifically exclude.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="2">The type of discount in the offer. Offers can discount by a percentage or amount off the product or order cost, or discount the order shipping costs. Offers can also provide the final cost, after discount, for a product.</li>
                <li value="3">How the offer is triggered. Some offers can be triggered by any shopper at any time, while some offers must be triggered using an action like entering a coupon code upon checkout or clicking a link in an email. </li>
                <li value="4">Where and how the offer appears. Offers use a point of promotion (POP) to determine where and how the offer content appears on your store. Some examples of POPs include interstitial pages or banners on your home page or shopping cart.</li>
                <li value="5">(For bundled offers) The type of bundle and the relationship between products in the bundle. Bundled offers have a <a href="mr_about_bundle_offers.htm#ParentChild">parent product and child product</a> and how those products behave in relation to one another is determined by the bundle type.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Offers and Points of Promotion (POPs)</h2>
            <p>Most offers use a point of promotion (POP) to control where or how the offer appears to shoppers and the offer type also influences which POPs can be used with an offer. Some offer types must use specific POPs for the offer to appear correctly on your store. Other POPs can be used with nearly any offer to control the offer behavior. The POPs you can select when you create an offer are determined by the offer and POP combinations you have set up . If a POP is not configured to work with a specific offer type, that POP will not be available when you create that type of offer.</p>
            <p>To use a specific POPs with a specific offer type, the POP must be configured to work with that offer type. That involves following the steps in <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Configuring Offer Types</b></a> and may require some additional work by our Site Design team.</p>
            <p>POPs can be banner images, home page images, pop-up windows, interstitial pages, and so on. Shipping offers and bundle offers do not require a POP because there is nothing to display about the offer. The same is true for other offers that do not visually appear on your store in the form of an image, shopping cart item, and so on.</p>
            <h2>Creating and Editing Offers</h2>
            <p>Offers are created using the Offer Wizard, which guides you through each step of the creation process. Each step of the wizard deals with one aspect of the offer setup, such as what products are included in the offer and how those products are priced or discounted. The Offer Wizard was developed to help you create complex offer setups more quickly and easily.</p>
            <p>After you create an offer (and even after you deploy an offer) you can edit the offer and change some of the options. Some options that affect how the offer is used cannot be changed, including the <a href="mr_about_offer_types.htm">offer type</a>, <a href="mr_about_offer_discounts.htm">offer discount</a>, and <a href="mr_offer_triggers_about.htm">offer trigger</a> (these options can only be set when an offer is created).</p>
            <p>Editing an offer is very similar to creating one except you do not use the Offer Wizard and instead edit the parts of the offer separately. If the offer you are editing has been deployed, you won’t be able to edit any of the options that affect how the offer behaves on your store. The options you cannot change after you deploy an offer are <a href="mr_about_offer_types.htm">offer type</a>, <a href="mr_about_offer_discounts.htm">offer discount</a>, and <a href="mr_offer_triggers_about.htm">offer trigger</a> (these can only be set when an offer is first created). </p>
            <p>The steps to create a new offer are similar regardless of the specific type of offer you are creating. As you work through the wizard, certain options will hide or show depending on the type of offer you are creating and choices you made in previous steps. If needed, you can go back to previous steps and change your choices.</p>
            <h3>How Offers Arbitrate</h3>
            <p>When multiple offers exist on your store, the offer(s) that provides the greatest discount within an order will be used. For more information about how this is determined, see <a href="mr_how_conflicting_offers_are_treated.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>How Conflicting Offers are Treated</b></a>.</p>
