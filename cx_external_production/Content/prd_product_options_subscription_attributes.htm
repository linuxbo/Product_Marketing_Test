                <h2>Transfer Product</h2>
                <p>The <i>Subscription Transfer Product</i> area is used to define the product that you want a shopper to receive when their subscription renews. </p>
                <p>Using transfer products, you can create a subscription that uses one product for the initial purchase and another product at renewal. You can even set up a subscription so that a different product is given to the shopper each time the subscription renews (sometimes called a "daisy chain"). Transfer products also make it easier to retire old subscriptions without interrupting or affecting the subscription service to your customers.</p>
                <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: The <i>Transfer Product</i> area will not appear when you are creating a new subscription product, but it will appear when you are editing a subscription product. </p>

                    <img src="Resources/Images/details_subscription-transfer-prods.jpg" />
                </p>
                <p>Click <b>Add Product</b> to search for and then select the product&#160;you want to get when their subscription for the current product renews. Keep in mind that the shopper will be billed the same amount for the renewal (the transfer product) as they were for the initial purchase (unless you set up a <a href="subs_renewal_pricing.htm">subscription renewal price list</a>)&#160;so the transfer product you select should be of equal or lesser value to the product for which you are setting up a transfer product.</p>
                <h2>Upgrade and Downgrade Products</h2>
                <p>The <i>Upgrade and Downgrade Products</i> area is where you define the products you want to be offered to a shopper when they choose to upgrade or downgrade their subscription.&#160;For example, you could have a set of subscription products with three levels of service or functionality and allow shoppers to upgrade to a higher level of their subscription, or downgrade to a lower level of their subscription. The upgrade or downgrade products are usually priced different, and shoppers are charged the new price when they upgrade or downgrade. Providing your shoppers with flexibility and choice in their subscription products can increase conversion and retention rates. To learn how upgrades and downgrades work, including how pricing is calculated, see <a href="subs_upgrade_downgrade_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Subscription Upgrades and Downgrades</b></a>.</p>

                                <p><b>Prorate on or before expiration date</b> – Used when you want a shopper who upgrades their subscription during the current subscription period to be charged a prorated price for the upgrade for the remaining time in their current subscription period. For example, let's say a shopper purchases a yearly subscription. Six months into their subscription the shopper decides to upgrade their subscription product. When the shopper upgrades they will be charged the difference between their original subscription product price and the upgrade product price for the remaining 6 months on their subscription term. </p>
                                <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: Be careful when using this option as the shopper's experience may be adversely affected. For example, if you choose to prorate pricing and a shopper upgrades their subscription a few days prior to expiration they will be charged a very small amount for the upgrade (because there is only a few days remaining in the subscription)&#160;and then charged again for the renewal when the subscription expires. Some shoppers may find multiple charges confusing or annoying.</p>
