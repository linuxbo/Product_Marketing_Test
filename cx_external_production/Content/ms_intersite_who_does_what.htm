                <MadCap:concept term="marketStream Intersite" />Intersite: Who Does What</h1>
            <p>There are three main roles for participants in the Intersite program: Product Owner, Product Seller, and Legal Agreements Approver. The role you take depends on what Intersite tasks you want to perform and how you plan to participate in the program. Understanding how these various roles differ and work together is important to understanding how you should use the Intersite options and features. </p>
            <h2>Product Owners</h2>
            <p>A Product Owner (also called a "publisher") is the owner of a product that will be sold in the Intersite program. Product Owners have two main responsibilities. The first responsibility is to add their companyâ€™s products to the Intersite Catalog (see <a href="ms_intersite_add_products_to_catalog.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Adding Your Products to the Intersite Catalog</b></a> for more information) and set up the product attributes for the Intersite Catalog such as price, name, description, and so on.</p>
            <p>The second main responsibility of a Product Owner is to manage the relationships with other Product Sellers in the Intersite program. This includes deciding which Product Sellers can sell products and at what price, including how much each Product Seller will get for every sale. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: We recommend that Product Owners be familiar with creating products and understand how their products should be customized (if at all) for the Intersite Catalog. See <a href="prd_product_options_channel_enter.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Entering Channel (marketStream) Settings</b></a> for more information</p>
            <h2>Product Sellers</h2>
            <p>A Product Seller is the party that sells an Intersite product on their store. Product Sellers are responsible for choosing the products from the Intersite Catalog that they want to sell on their store. </p>
            <p>Product Sellers cannot change the details of a product (name, description, image). Only a Product Owner can edit the product attributes in the Intersite Catalog. Product Sellers can change the selling price for a product, as long as the price they set falls between the range limit set by the Product Owner.</p>
            <h2><a name="Legal"></a>Legal Agreements Approver</h2>
            <p>Before a Product Owner or Product Seller can list or sell products from the Intersite Catalog, the legal agreements for the Intersite Program must be approved. </p>
            <p>The Legal Agreements Approver is the person responsible for reviewing and accepting the legal terms and contract for the Intersite Program, on behalf of the Product Seller company or Product Owner company. Legal terms only need to be approved once per company. When a contract is accepted it is applied to all sites that are part of the company. The person who is the Legal Agreements Approver will have a special role assigned to their user profile in the Command Console so that they can see and accept the Intersite legal agreements.</p>
            <p>There are different legal agreements for each role in the program (Product Seller or Product Owner), and all legal agreements must be accepted before full participation in the program can begin. Once a legal agreement is accepted an electronic copy will be sent to the email address entered when the contract was accepted. The email address you enter will also be used to communicate changes to the terms and conditions of the Intersite Program.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: The person who approves the legal agreements must be authorized by the Product Seller company or Product Owner company to accept legal contracts. Digital River staff cannot accept legal agreements on behalf of any party in the Intersite Program. Most often the Legal Agreements Manager is not the same person who lists products in the Intersite Catalog or chooses products from the Intersite Catalog to sell on their store.</p>
            <p>The person who accepts the agreements is provided with a special login and user role for the Command Console that allows them to view and accept the legal agreements for the Product Owner company or Product Seller company. The agreements for sellers and owners only need to be approved once and remain in effect until the agreement or participation in the program changes.</p>
            <h2>A Note About Roles in Intersite</h2>
            <p>It is very important to note that adding products in the Intersite Catalog and managing the relationships with Product Sellers are a separate role than the one for accepting legal agreements. This ensures that only those authorized to approve legal agreements for the Intersite Program do so, and only those that are authorized to add products to the Intersite Catalog do so. Make sure you understand your role in the Intersite Program and the user role(s) you have been assigned in the Command Console before taking any action with your products or the Intersite features.</p>
