                <MadCap:concept term="marketStream Intersite" />Adding Your Products to the Intersite Catalog</h1>
            <p>The Intersite Catalog is the repository for all products that are sold through the Intersite program. Products are added to the Intersite Catalog by Product Owners, and Product Sellers can browse the Intersite Catalog to find products they want to sell on their store.</p>
            <p>When a product is added to the Intersite Catalog, the Product Owner must define the pricing for the product, who else in the Intersite program can see and sell the product from the Intersite Catalog, and other attributes for the product such as name, description, product image, and so on. </p>
            <p>The attributes you define for your products in the Intersite Catalog are only used when the product is sold through the Intersite program on another store and will not affect how the product appears or is sold on your store.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: You do not have to list your products in the Intersite Catalog to sell products from the catalog but most participants in the program both list their products and sell other peopleâ€™s products from the Intersite Catalog. </p>
            <h2>Enabling the Channel Option</h2>
            <p>The process used to add products to the Intersite Catalog varies slightly, depending on whether the product is already in one of your catalogs or a new product you have yet to create in any catalog. </p>
            <p>To add a product to the Intersite Catalog, you simply enable the "Channel" option and then define the settings for that option in the Product Editor or Product Wizard. See <a href="prd_product_options_channel_enter.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Entering Channel (marketStream) Settings</b></a> for more information about how to define Channel settings.</p>
            <p>The image below shows the step in the New Product Wizard where the "Channel" option is selected. When this option is selected for a product and the attributes within that option have been defined, the product is added to the Intersite Catalog and available to others in the Intersite program. </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/selectingChannel.jpg" style="margin-left: 5.99976px;margin-top: 1.00008px;margin-right: 1.830227px;margin-bottom: 6.389286px;" />
            </p>
            <h2>Approving and Denying Product Sellers to Sell Your Product</h2>
            <p>When you add a product to the Intersite Catalog, you choose how you want Product Sellers approved to sell that specific product on their store. You can have Product Sellers automatically approved, or manually approved on a one-by-one basis. You may want to manually approve Product Sellers if you first want to see who wants to sell your products before allowing them to do so.</p>
            <p>If you select to manually approve sellers you will have to go into the Command Console and approve or reject sellers interested in selling your products on their store. Product Sellers will not be able to sell your products until they have been approved by you. </p>
            <p>If you select to approve Product Sellers automatically, you will not know who is selling your products on their store until you receive notification of a sale. You will also not be able to reject a Product Seller from selling your products without special assistance from Digital River. If you believe your products are being sold by questionable parties, contact your Store Operations team immediately. </p>
            <h2>Categorizing Your Product in the Intersite Catalog</h2>
            <p>Because the Intersite Catalog is shared across many different Product Sellers and Product Owners, the categories that are used to organize the Intersite Catalog must be generic and able to support many different types of products and publishers. </p>
            <p>When you add a product to the Intersite Catalog, you can choose which Intersite Catalog categories (up to three) your product most belongs in. You can choose several different categories and we suggest you choose as many that make sense to get the greatest exposure in the Intersite Catalog. </p>
            <p>Keep in mind that some Product Sellers may have rules that automatically check for products in certain categories, so choose your categories carefully.</p>
            <h2>Controlling Seller Visibility</h2>
            <p>You can control which Product Sellers can see your product in the Intersite Catalog. This limits who can add the product to their catalog and sell it on their store. </p>
            <p>When you add a product to the Intersite Catalog, you choose which companies participating in the Intersite program that you want to see the product, thus hiding it from everyone else.</p>
            <p>Until you set seller visibility for a product, all sellers in the Intersite program can see the product and sell it on their store. If you have set visibility for one or more sellers you must remove this visibility to have all sellers see your product again. See "Allowing All Sellers to See the Product" below for more information.</p>
            <p>When you allow a specific seller to see a product, they are able to find the product in the Intersite Catalog and add it to their catalog to sell on their store. Any seller that you have not explicitly allowed to see your product will not be able to see it in the Intersite Catalog and not be able to sell it on their store.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: If you remove visibility for a product from a seller that has already added your product to their catalog, an email is sent to the email address for the on record at that company notifying them of the change and that the product will be removed from their catalog. The product is removed from the product sellers catalog in three (3) days to allow any outstanding transactions to complete. </p>
            <h3>Allowing All Sellers to See the Product</h3>
            <p>If you do not set seller visibility for your product, all sellers in the Intersite program will be able to see your product and sell it on their store. This means that once you set the seller visibility, some sellers who once could see your product will find the product removed from their catalog after the three day grace period. </p>
            <p>You can allow all sellers to see the product by removing all sellers/companies from the list of those allowed to see the product. This resets the product to the default status where it is visible to all sellers in the Intersite Catalog.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/marketstream_visibility.gif" style="margin-left: 5.99976px;margin-top: 1.49976px;margin-right: 6.000484px;margin-bottom: 0.75024px;" />
            </p>
            <h2>Setting Up Pricing</h2>
            <p>Because the Intersite program is about other people selling your products, it is important that you be able to control how much your products are being sold for on other stores. When you add a product to the Intersite Catalog you can set a "Fixed Cost" and "MSRP" cost. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The "Fixed Cost" is the amount you will receive when your product is sold on another store. In that way, Fixed Cost can be thought of the cost you are selling your product for when others sell that product on their store. </li>
                <li value="2">The "MSRP" is the price you recommend Product Sellers charge for the product on their store. Product Sellers can set the selling price between their product cost and MSRP. Subtract the Product Sellerâ€™s fixed product cost from the selling price (default is MSRP) to get the margin the Product Seller will receive for each sale. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Setting Pricing by Product Seller</h3>
            <p>If needed, you can set custom pricing for specific Product Sellers. This is especially useful if you want to develop special relationships or partnerships with other Intersite participants that provides them with discounted or special pricing. </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/edit_pricing2.gif" style="margin-left: 5.99976px;margin-right: 6.000484px;" />
            </p>
            <h2>Entering Custom "Storefront Settings"</h2>
            <p>If the product you are adding to the Intersite Catalog already exists in your catalog, it is likely that the "Storefront Settings" you entered for the product will not be appropriate for the Intersite Catalog. For example, you may want to edit the product description to include your name as the publisher of the product, or change the product name to include your company name or other identifying information. </p>
            <p>You can choose, when defining the "Channel" option, to override the Storefront Settings for the product and enter Storefront Settings just for use in the Intersite Catalog. </p>
            <p>When you select the check box to "Override Storefront Settings," additional fields appear so you can enter custom content for the product for use in the Intersite Catalog. If you do not select this check box, the descriptions, keywords, and images you set for the product in the Store Details section higher on the page will be used. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: If you did not set the Store Details when the product was created, and do not enter them now or override them with custom content, you will receive an error message. You must enter descriptions, keywords, and images for the product in one of the two areas where this can be set. This applies to Intersite products only.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/oneNetworkProdDetails.jpg" style="margin-left: 5.99976px;margin-top: 0.75024px;margin-right: 4.320034px;" />
            </p>
            <h3>About Product Images and the Intersite Catalog</h3>
            <p>Products sold through the Intersite Program use the same file for both thumbnail and product images. We strongly recommend that any product images (both the regular image and the thumbnail) be no larger than 90&#160;<span class="_Override" style="font-family: Symbol;">Â´</span>&#160;90&#160;pixels. Larger images may distort the layout of the page and overlap product detail text or interfere with how the product is seen by shoppers.</p>
