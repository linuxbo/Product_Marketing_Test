                <MadCap:concept term="Offers" />About Offer Discounts</h1>
            <p>The offer discount is one of the most important aspects of an offer. Although you don’t have to give a discount with every offer, most offers provide some sort of pricing incentive for shoppers to redeem the offer.</p>
            <p>Discounts can be applied to products, shipping costs, or the total order cost. There are four basic types of discount: </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Amount</b> – Used when you want to specify the cost of the product after the discount. For example, product is $24 after discount.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Amount Off</b> – Used when you want to specify how much you want to discount (subtract) from the product price. For example, offer gives $10 off.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Percent Off</b> – Used when you want to discount the product price by a percentage. For example, provide a 15% discount.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>Tiered Discount</b> – Used when you want to provide a discount, based on the quantity purchased. For example, $5 off when 1 is purchased, $10 off when 2 are purchased, $15 when 3 are purchased, and so on. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="tiered discounts"></a>Tiered Discounts</h2>
            <p>A tiered discount is one where the discount is based on the quantity of product purchased or the total order value. Tiered discounts apply to every product you set up in the offer and are often used with products that are sold in larger quantities or when you want to entice a shopper to buy more of a specific product. Tiered discounts can be set as either a percentage off or amount off the price.</p>
            <p>Offers for individual products that use a tiered discount can only have the discount change based on quantity purchased. Offers for bundled products that use tiered discounts will apply the discount for the tier to all Child products in the offer. Offers created for all products in your store can have discounts based on either the quantity purchased or the total value of the purchase.</p>
            <h2>Restricting Discounts</h2>
            <p>Some offers allow you to restrict the discount to orders that match specific criteria such as a minimum number of products purchased, the total order value, or shipping method used. These types of discounts still use the amount off, percentage off, or tiered discount but are more restrictive in how and when the discount is applied to the product or order.</p>
            <h2>No Discount</h2>
            <p>Offers don’t have to discount the price at all— they can be created to up-sell or cross-sell different products to your shoppers. These types of offers can encourage shoppers to purchase more from your store.</p>
            <p>In cross-sell and up-sell offers, a shopper is shown one or more products for purchase when they add another product to the shopping cart. Cross-sell offers are usually accessories for the original product or compatible with the original product. Up-sell offers are usually higher priced versions of the product.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: Most offers are not tracked by a marketing and offer report if the offer does not provide a discount. All cross&#8209;sell, up&#8209;sell, and bundle offer types are tracked in the "Cross Sell Up Sell Reports" but the remaining offer types are not. If you want information about how offers that do not provide a discount are performing on your store, you can create a program to track those offers. See <a href="tp_about_tracking_programs.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Tracking Programs</b></a> for more information. </p>
