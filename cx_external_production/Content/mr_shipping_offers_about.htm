                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers Shipping;Offers Types" />About Shipping Offers</h1>
            <p>A shipping offer is one that provides a discount on shipping costs on orders that meet certain criteria. You can create a shipping offer for specific products and for orders that meet certain criteria such as a total order value, shipping destination, or chosen shipping method. </p>
            <p>When you create a shipping offer you can restrict the offer to orders with certain products or orders that meet or exceed a total value limit. You can choose specific products to discount shipping for, or have the shipping discount applied for all products in an order. You can also create discounts for orders that use a certain shipping method or that are being shipped to a specific destination (the shipping address is used to determine if the order is eligible for the offer). Some shipping discount offer types allow you to restrict the offer by both destination and shipping method. </p>
            <p>Shipping offers can discount shipping costs by a percentage of cost or by an amount of the cost. You can limit the total uses for the offer, and in some cases limit the number of the times the offer can be redeemed by an individual shopper. If desired, the offer can also be restricted to one or more locales.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: Shipping offers do not require a POP when they are used on your store, however you may want to use a banner image or pop-up to promote the shipping offer.</p>
            <h3>Configuring Shipping Order Value Offers</h3>
            <p>Shipping order value offers are used to provide a promotion or discount when the total order value reaches or exceeds a certain amount that you set when you create the offer. However, because multiple offers can be applied to the same order you may want to control whether order value offers use the order total calculated before or after any other discounts are applied. </p>
            <p>When configuring offer types for a site (see <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Configuring Offer Types</b></a>) there is a setting that determines whether the order value (total) should be the order total before or after any other discounts have been applied. Most external users will not have access to the "Configure Offer Types" screen but you can contact your Store Operations team to learn more about setting this option for your store.</p>
            <h3>Options When Creating Offers</h3>
            <p>When creating a shipping offer there are several different things you can do to define how the offer behaves on your store. The following is a summary of some of those options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Restrict the offer to orders with specific products or products within a specific category.</li>
                <li value="2">Restrict the offer to orders that meet or exceed a total value limit.</li>
                <li value="3">Apply the shipping discount to specific products or have the shipping discount applied for all products in an order. </li>
                <li value="4">Provide a discount for products or orders that use a certain shipping method.</li>
                <li value="5">Provide a discount for products or orders that are being shipped to a specific destination. In these offers, the shipping address/country is used to determine if the order is eligible for the offer. </li>
                <li value="6">Provide a discount for products or orders that are being shipped to a specific destination <span class="_Override" style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> use a specific shipping method.</li>
            </ul>
