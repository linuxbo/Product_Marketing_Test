            <p>The marketStream Channel Intersite Program is a part of the marketStream suite, a unique set of solutions to help you expand sales, enhance profits, and find new channels to sell your products. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCToggler MCTogglerHead MCTogglerHotSpot MCToggler_Open toggler MCTogglerHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" data-mc-targets="more"><img class="MCToggler_Image_Icon" src="../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />More...</a></p>
            <p>The marketStream Intersite Program allows clients with Digital River hosted stores to sell each other's products on their stores. Each time a sale is made, the store selling the product gets a cut of that sale. The Intersite program can be a great way to increase your revenue and build selling relationships with other stores.</p>
            <p style="display: none;" data-mc-target-name="more">When you participate in the marketStream Intersite Program, you list your own products or sell the products of others from the marketStream Common Catalog. The Common Catalog is used as a  repository for all products sold through a marketStream program. To participate in the Intersite Program you must sign up for it through your Store Operations team and approve the legal terms and contract for the Intersite Program. Once approved, you can begin choosing the marketStream products you want to sell on your site and list your own products in the Common Catalog for others to sell.</p>
            <p>To learn more about the marketStream Intersite Program, see one of the topics below:&#160;</p>

            <h2>Product Sellers</h2>
            <p>As a product seller in the marketStream Intersite program, you can search the exclusive Common Catalog for products to sell on your site. Once you gain approval from the product owner to sell a product on your site, you can add it to your catalog and receive a share of the profit for every sale.</p>
            <h2>Product Owners</h2>
            <p>As a product owner in the marketStream Intersite program, you can list your products to the Common Catalog so that other sellers can add your product to their catalog and site. </p>
            <p>When you list a product in the Common Catalog you can set custom pricing (for all sellers, or specific sellers you choose) and details (such as images and text) that are used when the product is sold through the Intersite Program. You can also control which marketStream product sellers can see the product in the Common Catalog and therefore control who can add the product to their catalog.</p>
            <h2>Accepting Legal Agreements </h2>
            <p>Before a Product Owner or Product Seller can list or sell products from the Common Catalog, the legal agreements for the Intersite Program must be approved. </p>
            <p>The person who accepts the agreements is provided with a special login and user role that allows them to view and accept the legal agreements for the Product Owner company or Product Seller company. The agreements for sellers and owners only need to be approved once and remain in effect until the agreement or participation in the program changes.
</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that the party that accepts the terms and conditions of the Intersite Program must be authorized to accept the terms for the Product Owner or Product Seller company. Most often this is not the same person who lists products in the Common Catalog or chooses products from the Common Catalog to sell on their site.
</p>
            <p>To learn how agreements are accepted, see <a href="ms_intersite_legal_marketstream_selling.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Accepting the Product Seller Company Legal Agreement</b></a> or <a href="ms_intersite_legal_marketstream_owning.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Accepting the Product Owner Company Legal Agreement</b></a>.</p>
