                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers Display Content" />About Offer Display Content</h1>
            <p>Display content is the text, images, and other content that is seen when an offer is viewed on your store. Depending on the offer type, you may have different display content for the offer and for each product in the offer. If the offer is set to support multiple locales, you may also have different display content for each locale (see <a href="lcz_localize_offers_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Localizing Offers</b></a> for more information). Keep in mind that if you have chosen to restrict the offer to specific locales, you should enter locale-specific content for the offer in this step. If you do not provide content for the supported locales, the content for the default (base) locale will be used.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: Display content is usually entered as straight text or HTML but you can use other types of content if it is supported by your store. For example, you can use links or paths to images and other files. To use more specialized display content with your offers and POPs, please contact your Store Operations team. They will work with you and the Digital River Site Design team to ensure that your store is set up to support advanced display content.</p>
            <p>The list below summarizes the different elements that make up the display content for offers. Which elements are used by an offer will depend on the POP. See the information further on in this section for more about what display content elements are used with each main POP type.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Header</b> – Text or content you want to appear at the top of the offer. Sometimes the header is used to hold a URL/link for a clickable image such as a banner.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Footer</b> – Text or content that you want to appear at the bottom of the offer.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Sales Pitch Extra Info</b> – Text or content that you want to appear below the header. There are multiple "sales pitches" so you can include multiple lines of text if needed.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>Identifying Discount Text</b> – Text or content that you want to appear below the Sales Pitch and above any product information in the offer.</li>
                <li value="5"><b>Offer Image(s) and Extra Image(s)</b> – Image(s) or content that you want to appear below the header.</li>
                <li value="6"><b>Product Sales Pitch(es)</b> – Text or content you want to appear above the product image and information in the offer content.</li>
                <li value="7"><b>Product Thumbnail</b> – Image you want to use when a product is shown in the offer content. If you do not select an image here, the offer will attempt to use the Product Image first, followed by the Thumbnail.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;Display content is often customized by our Site Design team for each individual store. The information in this section is meant to serve as a guide for when you have to enter display content for specific POPs and offer types. If you have questions about what display content is used by your store, contact your Store Operations team.</p>
            <p>The image below shows an example of where the various display content elements are used within a POP to create the offer image. Keep in mind that this example shows the default set up and your store may have been customized to use the display content differently than what is shown here. </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/offer_display_content.jpg" style="margin-left: 4.5px;margin-top: 3.18744px;margin-right: 3.638168px;margin-bottom: 14.21496px;" />
            </p>
            <p>Whether an offer uses each display content element depends on the POP used by the offer. This means that for some offers and POPs, you will not have to define all the display content because some are not used by the offer. The image below shows a sample POP with the display content areas highlighted.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/display_content_schema_646x357.jpg" style="margin-left: 9px;margin-top: 2.0628px;margin-right: 6.000488px;margin-bottom: 11.99953px;width: 646;height: 357;" />
            </p>
            <p>POPs that show child products in the offer can be set up to show any attributes that are saved with the product. By default, most POPs will show the product name, image, and pricing but you can have your store customized to show other attributes such as any Custom Family Attributes you use on your store. </p>
            <h3>Tokens</h3>
            <p>When you are entering display content you can use a token to automatically insert specific information or content in the offer display content. A token is a small piece of code (similar to tags used in XML and HTML) that you can add to the display content to dynamically insert information or content on the page where the token code is added. </p>
            <p>When entering the display content you will see an "Available Tokens" link that you can click to choose the token you want to use. To learn more about getting a different token created for your store, contact your Store Operations team.</p>
            <h3>Display Content for Site Merchandising POPs</h3>
            <p>Site Merchandising POPs are usually customized by client and store. For this reason there is no standard definition as to what you should enter for the various display content areas. You can test what appears in each area by creating an offer, entering content in those areas, and viewing the offer on your test store. Otherwise, for help determining which display content is used with a specific POP on your store, contact your Store Operations team. </p>
            <h3>Display Content for Interstitial POPs</h3>
            <p>The following summarizes the display content that is used with Interstitial POPs. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Header</b> – Content you want to appear at the top of the interstitial page.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Footer</b> – Content you want to appear at the bottom of the interstitial page.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Identifying Discount Text</b> – Used to indicate how many columns you want the interstitial to have. You can enter 3, 2, or 1 to indicate how many columns you want. If you enter nothing, the page will assume the default of three (3) columns. If you enter 1, each product in the offer will appear on a different row.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>Sales Pitch(es)</b> – The text you would like to appear with each product. </li>
                <li value="5"><b>Offer Image(s)</b> – The image(s) you want to appear in the interstitial for the offer. </li>
                <li value="6"><b>Product Image(s)</b> – The image(s) you want to appear in the interstitial for each of the products in the offer. If you do not select an image here, the offer will attempt to use the Product Image first, followed by the Thumbnail Image.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Content for Pop-Up POPs</h3>
            <p>The following is a summary of what you can enter for the display content when using one of the Pop-Up and Drop-In POP types. If an element is not listed here, it means that by default the POP is not set up to use that element. </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Header</b> – The "alt" text for your pop-up image. When you enter text, do not use any single or double quotes or your POP will not work. Single quotes are also known as apostrophes (used in contractions) and double quotes are standard quotation marks used around quoted text and special terms.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Footer</b> – The width and height of the pop-up window to accommodate your offer/pop-up image. The first number is the width and the second the height (separate them with a space). We recommend you take your image dimensions and add 11 pixels to the width and 29 pixels to the height and use that as a starting size for the pop-up. You may want to tweak those values once your preview your offer.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Offer Image(s)</b> – The image(s) you want to use for the pop-up. The image is clickable and can take the shopper to the product details page, or initiate some other action on the store (Site Design work may be required).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Content for Shopping Cart POPs</h3>
            <p>Shopping cart POPs are usually customized by client and store. For this reason there is no standard definition as to what you should enter for the various display content areas. You can test what appears in each area by creating an offer, entering content in those areas, and viewing the offer on your test store. Otherwise, for help determining which display content is used with a specific POP on your store, contact your Store Operations team. </p>
