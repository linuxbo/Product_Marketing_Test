                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers Mystery Discounts" />Creating Mystery Discount Offers</h1>
            <p>A mystery discount offer is one where the shopper receives a discount that is randomly selected for them. Typically, shoppers are not aware which discount they are getting until they add a product to their shopping cart, however . Commonly, mystery discount offers provide a really good discount to a handful of shoppers and a lower discount to many more shoppers. </p>
            <p>There are many different ways you can use a mystery discount on your store. The steps below outline how you can create a mystery discount offer. We suggest you use these guidelines and a little bit of imagination to create a mystery discount that is perfectly tailored for your products and shoppers.</p>
            <h2>Basic Steps for Creating Mystery Discounts</h2>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">Create an offer for each discount or promotion you want to have on your store.  For example, if you want to provide three percentage discounts (10%, 25%, and 40% ) randomly to your shoppers you would create a separate offer for each discount percentage. If you wanted to provide random shipping discounts you would create shipping offers for each discount you wanted to provide.<ul><li value="1">You can create basic discount offers, shipping offers, or even bundle or cross-sell offers. Pretty much any offer type can be used in a "mystery" fashion, but you cannot use offers that cannot be used with the <a href="mr_about_offer_triggers_site_test.htm">"site test" trigger</a>. </li><li value="2">Make sure you select the "site test"&#160;trigger type because you will use a Site Optimizer test to randomly provide shoppers with the offer.</li><li value="3">We recommend that you use <a href="mr_about_usage_controls.htm">usage controls</a> with the offers to limit how many times each offer can be redeemed. </li><li value="4">You can create offers for specific products, categories, or all products on your store. The products or categories you create the offers for is determined by how you will use or promote the mystery discount. For example, you could create offers for you best-selling or most popular products and provide a mystery discount on those, or create an offer for all products on your store and just provide a discount on the order.</li><li value="5">We suggest that you use the <a href="mr_about_offer_description_in_cart.htm">"offer description in cart"</a> to communicate to your shoppers the discount they are getting and why.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="2"><a href="so_create_edit_test.htm">Create a Site Optimizer test for the offers you have created</a>. <ul><li value="1">Add the offers you have created for the discount(s) you want to provide to the Site Optimizer test and assign an appropriate percentage split for each one. </li><li value="2">The split determines how many shoppers will receive each discount. For example, if you are offering three percentage discounts (10%, 25%, and 40%) you could assign the 10% discount offer a 50% split, the 25% discount offer a 40% split, and the 40% discount offer a 10% split. This would mean that 5 out of 10 shoppers will get a 10% discount, 4 out 10 will get a 25% discount, and 1 out of 10 will get a 40% discount.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="3">(Optional) Create custom pages as landing pages for the offers. <ul><li value="1">The landing pages could tell the shopper what discount they will get or what products are included in the promotion. </li><li value="2">If you use custom pages with your mystery offer, you must also create links to those custom pages and distribute those links to your shoppers. </li><li value="3">If you use a custom page, don't forget to include a link so the shopper can access your store from the landing page.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="4"><a href="prv_preview_store.htm">Use the preview feature to test the offers, custom pages (if used), and Site Optimizer test</a>. Make sure the offers  behave and appear as you want them too. Keep in mind that you will not know which offer you will get until you enter the coupon code in the shopping cart. Don't forget that because of how Site Optimizer works, you will randomly be given one of the offers in the test so you will not get the offers in a particular order.</li>
                <li value="5">Deploy the offers, custom pages (if used) and the Site Optimizer test on your store.</li>
                <li value="6">Publicize the offer to your shoppers on your store, in social media, or through email. If you are using custom pages, distribute links to the custom pages to your shoppers. </li>
            </ol>
