                <MadCap:concept term="Purchase Plans" /><a name="kanchor236"></a>About Target Markets</h1>
            <p>When you create a purchase plan you create "target markets," which are used to control the access and branding of your purchase plan store. With target markets, you can create a unique experience for different groups of your purchase plan shoppers. Purchase plans can have multiple target markets with different settings.</p>
            <p>There are three parts to every target market:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><a href="#AccessMethods" class="selected">Access Method</a> – How the shopper is authenticated to shop the purchase plan and make a purchase. </li>
                <li value="2"><a href="#Branding" class="selected">Branding</a> – Defines the look and feel of your store, including theme, logo, and name.</li>
                <li value="3"><a href="#InvitationLink" class="selected">Invitation Link</a> – The link used to access your purchase plan store. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="AccessMethods"></a>Access Methods</h2>
            <p>An access method is the way in which a shopper can access a purchase plan. There are several different types of access methods you can set up for a purchase plan (methods are listed in order of most restrictive to least restrictive in the list below and on the screen in the Command Console):</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Email Address</b> – Shopper must enter their email address and it must be an address that you have associated with the purchase plan. </li>
                <li value="2"><b>Email Domain</b> – Shopper must enter their email address and it must use one of the domains you have entered for the purchase plan. A domain is the end of the email address, such as the "digitalriver.com" in "jane.doe@digitalriver.com."</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Email Invitation</b> – Shopper must be invited to the purchase plan through an email forwarded to them by someone they know, who then has to approve they invited the shopper if the shopper places an order. Purchase plans that use this access method are also called "friends and family" plans. </li>
                <li value="4"><b>Generic Identifier</b> – Shopper must enter a name and a PIN created for the purchase plan. Purchase plans can have multiple name and PIN combinations used to access the plan. </li>
                <li value="5"><b>IP Address</b> – Shopper must be on a network using a specific IP&#160;address or an IP address within a defined range.</li>
                <li value="6"><b>Referral URL</b> – Shopper must click a link to access the purchase plan. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Combining Access Methods</h3>
            <p>You can use more than one access method in a target market to provide additional authentication for a purchase plan. Some access methods cannot be combined with other methods because of how those methods provide access to a purchase plan. The following outlines some recommendations for combining access methods in your purchase plan.</p>
            <table style="width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/gc_cx_tablestyles.css');" class="TableStyle-gc_cx_tablestyles" cellspacing="0">

                <col class="Column-Column1" />
                <thead>
                    <tr class="Head-Header1">
                        <th class="HeadE-Column1-Header1">Access Methods</th>
                        <th class="HeadD-Column1-Header1">How It Would Work</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr class="Body-Body1">
                        <td class="BodyE-Column1-Body1">Email Address and IP&#160;Address</td>
                        <td class="BodyD-Column1-Body1">
                            <p>Shoppers must enter a specific email address to access the purchase plan, as well as be using a computer with a specific IP&#160;address. This is the most restrictive (secure) combination of access methods.</p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="Body-Body1">
                        <td class="BodyE-Column1-Body1">&#160;</td>
                        <td class="BodyD-Column1-Body1">&#160;</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr class="Body-Body1">
                        <td class="BodyB-Column1-Body1">Referral URL and Generic Identifier</td>
                        <td class="BodyA-Column1-Body1">Shoppers click a link and then enter the login credentials (name and PIN)&#160;you have provided them. This combination would work well if distributing your purchase plan information through email marketing.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h3>Access Methods for Order Placement</h3>
            <p>You can add an additional level of authentication by requiring shoppers to enter a specific email address or use an email address from a specific domain to complete checkout. When you use this option, email address or email domain effectively become an additional access method on the purchase plan, and will be used to provide access to the plan and place an order with the plan.</p>
            <p>Setting order-level authentication is done using the <i>Advanced Settings</i> for the access method.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #b22222;">PICTURE&#160;HERE.</span>
            </p>
            <h2><a name="Branding"></a>Branding</h2>
            <p>The branding for a target market determines the name the shopper sees when they visit the store, the theme used to control the look and feel of the store, and the logo that appears in the store. You can define different branding for each target market, thus creating a uniquely branded shopping experience for different groups of users. </p>
            <p>When you create a purchase plan you can also define branding for the store. If you do not change this for a target market, the target market will use the branding you have defined for the purchase plan as a whole. </p>
            <h2><a name="InvitationLink"></a>Invitation Link</h2>
            <p>The invitation link is the URL you should give to shoppers (or insert into a web page or email) to provide shoppers in the target market access to the purchase plan store. The invitation links are different for each target market, so make sure you get the right link for the target market you want to provide access to.</p>
            <p>Once you create a target market in a purchase plan, the invitation link is created. If you change certain parts of the target market the <span style="color: #b22222;">MORE&#160;INFO&#160;HERE.</span></p>
