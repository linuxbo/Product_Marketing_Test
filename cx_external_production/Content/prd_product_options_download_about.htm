                <MadCap:concept term="Download;Fulfillment;Products Options" />About the Download Fulfillment Option</h1>
            <p>The Download fulfillment method is used when you have a product that you want shoppers to download upon purchase. This fulfillment method is usually used with digital products such as software, games, and so on.</p>
            <p>When you set a product to use the download fulfillment method, you can use Digital River as the fulfiller or indicate if you have contracted with a third-party fulfiller for the product. If you select Digital River as your fulfiller there are several options you must set for the download to work on your store. These options are discussed more below.</p>
            <h2>About the Download File(s)</h2>
            <p>The file(s) a shopper will download must be uploaded to the Command Console for fulfillment to occur. When you upload your files you can set a Site Display Name for the file(s). This name will appear to shoppers on your store and possibly in email notifications sent to them about their order. </p>
            <p>There is no limit to the number or size of files you upload. However, larger files may cause the connection to "time out" before the upload completes. We suggest that if you have problems uploading your files to the system you contact your Store Operations team. They can work with you to get the files uploaded to the system using a FTP account.</p>
            <p>Once you upload your file(s) you must then choose if you want to make downloads available to shoppers for 30 days or 60 days after purchase. </p>
            <p>Download files are specific to the product version where they are added (see <a href="prd_product_status_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" xrefformat="{b}{para}{/b}"><b>About Product Status</b></a> for more about product versions) and deleting a download file will prompt a new version of the product to be created. This means that if a download file is deleted from the product, a version of that file will remain with the version of the product where it was added. A shopper who purchased the product will still be able to download the file(s) as long as they are within the Time Limit set for the download, unless the shopper purchased the Extended Download Service (EDS). </p>
            <h2>Extended Download Service</h2>
            <p>The <a href="eds_about_eds.htm">Extended Download Service (EDS)</a> is an optional service provided by Digital River to stores that have digital or download fulfillment. EDS provides your shoppers the security of being able to download their purchases for an extended amount of time, usually 2-3 years after purchase. The extended download time is in addition to the normal time frame set for the download. </p>
            <h2>Setting Other Download Limits</h2>
            <p>In addition to limiting how long after purchase the file(s) can be downloaded, you can also set how many download attempts can be made (in case the initial download attempt fails because of connection issues) and how many IP addresses can attempt a download. </p>
