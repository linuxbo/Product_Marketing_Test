            <p>The <i>Create Product</i> wizard is used to create new products in your catalog. The wizard walks you through the process step by step, showing only those options and fields that are relevant to the product you are creating. </p>
            <P>The product setup for your company determines what fields and default values are seen when creating or editing a product. This means that the information in this topic may not reflect what you see on your site. Contact your Store Operations team to learn more about product setup and default values.</P>
            <h2>About Variations</h2>
            <p>Variations are different versions of the same product. For example, a software product can have two different variations, one for the Mac version and one for the PC version. </p>
            <p>When you create a product with variations, you first define the "base" attributes for the product (and variations). This includes supported locales, delivery types, store images, and so on. When you create a variation, the base attributes are copied to the variation and if you do not define some attributes before you create a variation, the variation will not have those attributes. You should define as many base attributes as you can before you create your variations. </p>
            <p>After you create variations for a product you can customize the attributes and options for each variation. For example, you can set a different price for one variation, or select a different product image for another.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">To create a product (with variations):</p>
