            <p>The ability to create multiple Backup Media configurations means that you can have more than one configuration active on your store. Understanding how configurations arbitrate can help you decide what type of configurations to create and when to make them available on your store.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: We strongly recommend that stores using Backup Media create at least one general configuration before creating any targeted configurations. This will provide the best experience for your shoppers and ensure that a targeted configuration will never be used for purchases of products the configuration was never meant to target.</p>
            <p>There are two types of configurations you can create: general and targeted. A general configuration is one that is used regardless of the product purchased. By default, you must create at least one general configuration so that Backup Media purchases on your store always have a configuration to use. </p>
            <p>A targeted configuration is one where the configuration is only used when specific products are purchased. This means that you can create a configuration for a specific product and have the trial software on the product, as well as the branding on the disc target the shopper based on their purchase.</p>
            <p>The following outlines the rules that are used when deciding which configuration should "win" when more than one product with a configuration is purchased.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Targeted configurations always win over general configurations</b>. So, if a shopper purchases two products (one with a targeted configuration and one that uses a general configuration) the targeted configuration will be used to create the Backup Media for both products.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>When two or more targeted configurations can be used, the configuration associated to the most expensive product (before discounts) wins</b>. This means that if a shopper purchases two products (both with a targeted configuration) the product that is priced higher (before discounts) wins. In the case where the products are priced the same, the product that was added to the shopping cart first wins.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>If a product does not have a targeted configuration, the default configuration is used</b>. Keep in mind however, that the default configuration can also be a targeted configuration. We do not recommend that your default configuration be a targeted configuration because targeted configurations are meant to be used for shoppers to purchase specific products. We strongly recommend that you make your default configuration a general configuration and set it up so that it is appropriate for all purchases of Backup Media on your store. Otherwise, you may find that a configuration you intended to be used for a target audience is used for all Backup Media purchases. </li>
            </ul>
