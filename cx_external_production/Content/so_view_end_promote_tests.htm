            <p>The performance of a test can be viewed while it is live, or after is
 has been completed. This is critical to determine a winning test approach
 when making a decision about what to do with each test level. </p>
            <p>Digital River uses a standard  cumulative distribution function (CDF) to calculate the performance of each test level in the test. When viewing the details of a test, you will see a <b>Confidence</b> rating for each test level. Most often the level with the highest Confidence score would be promoted to your store. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: If the Confidence rating for the challenger level(s) is near 0% it means that the champion (control) level is winning the test. </p>

            <h2>Promoting Test Levels</h2>
            <p>After you create a Site Optimizer Test, you can choose to promote one or more of the test levels, depending on how the level performed. When you promote a level it becomes an active offer on your site and acts like any other offer or content layout on your store. If the system detects offers that may interfere
 with the test you are promoting, a message will appear and a list of the conflicting offers
 is shown. You should retire any offers that will interfere with the
 test level offer you are promoting.</p>
            <table style="width: auto;mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/for_dropdowntext.css');margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;" class="TableStyle-for_dropdowntext" cellspacing="0">
                <tbody>
                    <tr class="Body-Body1">

                            <p style="display: none;" data-mc-target-name="conflict1">A conflicting offer is one that may interfere or affect the current test level
 offer you are promoting. For example, if you created a marketing offer
 with a discount to Product A of 50% and your test levels contain price
 discounts for Product A of 10% and 20%, the test levels would be superseded
 by the 50% discount. This condition would impact the test results, and
 therefore it is always advised to check conflicting offers shown to determine
 any possible problems that may occur with your test. </p>
                            <p style="display: none;" data-mc-target-name="conflict2">Marketing offers that are triggered by promotional URL or coupon code do not typically represent
 a test risk since the user must trigger the offer. However, marketing offers set to <i>Always
 Triggered</i> will be subject to best price arbitration and can therefore compete
 with the offers you include in your test. </p>

            <p>When a test level is promoted, all other test level offers in the test
 are retired and the promoted level becomes the fully deployed offer on
 the site.  The
 test will stop gathering data within Site Optimizer but will capture
 regular Offer ID-based tracking within the eReporting tools.</p>
