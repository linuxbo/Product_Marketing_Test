                <MadCap:concept term="Physical on Demand;Products Options;Fulfillment" />About the Physical on Demand (POD) Fulfillment Option</h1>
            <p>The Physical on Demand (POD) fulfillment method allows you to provide a physical version of your software, game, or digital product without maintaining a physical inventory that can become old or outdated. The POD option is most used by stores that already provide a downloadable version of their product(s) but want to provide shoppers an opportunity to purchase a physical product as well. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: POD is only available if you have signed up for it via your Store Operations team. If you have not signed up for POD, the physical on demand delivery type will not be available when creating a new product or editing an existing product. Contact your Store Operations team to learn how you can get the POD fulfillment option on your store.</p>
            <h2>How POD Fulfillment Works</h2>
            <p>Using the POD fulfillment option isn’t much different than other fulfillment options, except you must do a little setup for the product prior to deploying it to your store. The setup dictates what files are burned on the physical disc(s) and what artwork is used for the disc image and disc case image.</p>
            <p>To a shopper browsing your store, a POD product doesn’t look that different than a traditional physical software, game, or digital product. When a shopper is viewing the product they may see "Physical on Demand" as a delivery option but everything else on the product and store looks and operates as it normally would. This means you can use the POD option without affecting or interfering with the shopping experience. </p>
            <p>When a shopper places an order for a POD product, that order is submitted to one of our POD fulfillment centers in either Germany or the United States, depending on the shipping address for the order. Depending on the POD setup, the physical product may be created and ready for shipment in as little as a day. </p>
            <h3>Disc Type and Shipping Costs</h3>
            <p>When you set up a POD product using CMPS&#160;as the POD fulfiller, you can also select the disc type the product will use. The disc type not only determines the size of the disc but also the case the disc will be sent in. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: You can only select the disc type for POD&#160;products fulfilled by CMPS.</p>
            <p>Each disc type has an associated weight to it and that is how the shipping costs will be calculated and charged for the POD&#160;product. The following outlines the disc types you can select, as well as the weight for each type.</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Cardboard mailer: 3 oz</li>
                <li value="2">Slim DVD: 5 oz</li>
                <li value="3">Standard DVD: 5 oz</li>
                <li value="4">Double DVD: 6 oz</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Creating POD Products</h2>
            <p>The first step to creating a POD product is to create a new product or edit an existing product so that it uses the Physical on Demand (POD) fulfillment method. Once the POD option is enabled you must set up the POD option by selecting the images for the CD/DVD label and case artwork and all of the product files (executables, binaries, etc.) that will be burned onto the physical disc. After you set up the POD option, you can set up the rest of the product settings as you would with any other product.</p>
            <p>When you are done setting up the POD options (disc contents and packaging) you must submit the product setup to Digital River for testing and approval. When you submit a POD product for approval, the POD setup is locked and cannot be changed or deployed until the test is complete and approval has been given. </p>
            <p>During the approval process, Digital River verifies that the files and images can be used to create a physical disc. The process usually takes three (3) days and you will be emailed when the product has been approved and ready for the next step.</p>
            <p>After your product has been approved by Digital River, you must give one final approval for the product and then deploy the product to your store so it can be purchased by shoppers. If needed you can reject the setup and make changes to the disc contents and packaging and submit the product again for approval.</p>
            <h2>Placing a Test Order for POD Products</h2>
            <p>Once you get final approval for your POD product layout, you may want to make the product "invisible" so you can place a test order and see the final POD product result before showing the product to your shoppers. For more information about placing test orders, see <a href="to_place_test_order.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref" data-mc-unresolved-link="import-link:testing_products_offers_1677034048_56534"><b>Placing Test Orders</b></a>.</p>
            <p>The best way to test your POD product is to first make it "invisible" on your store. To make a product invisible, simply clear/deselect the <b>Is Viewable</b> check box (see <a href="prd_product_settings_basic_about.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Basic Product Settings</b></a> to learn where to find this check box) before you deploy the product. </p>
            <p>Once the POD product is "invisible" and deployed on your store you will be able to place a test order for the POD product (you will have to know the PID and enter that in the URL to load the product details page on your store) but shoppers won’t be able to find the product through the category list or search result pages.</p>
            <p>Once you receive your POD test product in the mail (usually in a few days), don’t forget to go back to the product and select the <b>Is Viewable</b> check box and deploy again so that the product will be seen on your store.</p>
