                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers PoPs;Offers Types" />Offer and POP Examples</h1>
            <p>This topic shows some common uses for offers and points of promotion (POPs) on your store. Some of these examples show offers that use specific POPs to visually display the offer content, while other examples simply show a way to use offers to increase traffic or revenue on your store. </p>
            <h2>Home Page or Shopping Cart Banners</h2>
            <p>The "Banner" offer type is a flexible way to create promotions that appear as clickable banner images throughout your store. Usually banners appear in either the shopping cart or on the home page, but your store can be customized to include banners anywhere you want to use them.</p>
            <p>The examples below show how the "Banner" offer type was used with the "Banner_HomePageLocal" POP to create offers that entice shoppers to click the banner to learn more about a promotion or product.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/pop_example2.jpg" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <h2>General Store Promotions or Product Discounts</h2>
            <p>The "Discount" offer type is one of the most commonly used offers types. You can use this offer to provide a discount on one or more products on your store (discount is not required, however). You do not have to use a POP with the "Discount" offer type but most stores use one to advertise a special sale or product on your store.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/pop_example1.jpg" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <p>The example on the left shows how the "Discount" offer type can be used with the "SiteMerchandising_HomePageLocal" POP to provide a special discount on a product and promote that discount on the Home page. The example on the right shows how a similar offer that provides no discount can be used on the Home page.</p>
            <h2><a name="offers_2552651814_90892"></a>Bundle Offers</h2>
            <p>The "Bundle" offer type is used when you want to offer two or more products together, with or without a discount.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/bundle1.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <p>The example above shows how the "Bundle" offer type was used with a "SiteMerchandising_HomePageLocal" POP to offer two products together with a discount on the store home page.</p>
            <h2>Buy One, Get One Free!</h2>
            <p>The "Buy M, Get N" offer type is used to provide a shopper an incentive for purchasing from your store. Most "Buy M, Get N" offers provide the secondary product for free or at a low price but the specific pricing is up to you.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/offer_example6.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <h2>Product Launches</h2>
            <p>There are several ways you can use an offer to announce upcoming releases or new product launches. Many stores use a "SiteMerchandising" or "Pop-Up" POP to announce new products to shoppers.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/productLaunch1.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <h2>Feature Products and Top Sellers</h2>
            <p>The "Feature Products" offer type is an easy way to create a list or group of specific products that you want to promote on your store. This offer type usually uses one of the "Site Merchandising" POPs to display the list of on your store.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/TopProducts.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <p>The example above shows the default style for a "Feature Products" offer type using the "SiteMerchandising_HomePageTopSellers" POP. Most stores choose to customize their store specials, featured products, and top sellers POPs to use advanced layout and store design. Contact your Store Operations team for more information. </p>
            <h2>Free Shipping Offers</h2>
            <p>There are several different types of shipping offers you can create to discount shipping based on the total order value, the products ordered, the shipping destination, or the shipping method used.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/offer_example7.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <p>The example above shows how the "Shipping Order Value" offer type can be used with the "SiteMerchandising_HomePageLocal" POP to create an offer for free shipping on a specific product. </p>
            <h2>Seasonal and Holiday Offers</h2>
            <p>There are several events throughout the year that you can use to market and promote your store or products. Holidays are the most common but we invite you to think of other events throughout the year where special offers or promotions can be used. </p>
            <p>For example, you can create an offer specific to a particular holiday or season.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/seasonal1.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">You can also create an offer for a special event or special time of year, such as "Back to School."</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                <img src="Resources/Images/Back2School.gif" class="icon" />
            </p>
