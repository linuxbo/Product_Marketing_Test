                <MadCap:concept term="marketStream Intersite" />marketStream Intersite Program Roles</h1>
            <p>Depending on how you plan to participate in the Intersite program, you can have one or more roles. These roles correlate to the user roles assigned to your user profile in <span class="gc_cx_variablesPlatformName3" data-mc-conditions="gc_cx_conditions.cx_external">(Undefined variable: gc_cx_variables.PlatformName3)</span>. This determines the tasks you can perform and what parts of the system you can access.</p>
            <p>It is very important to note that listing products in the Common Catalog and managing the relationships with Product Sellers are given a separate role than the one used for accepting legal agreements. This was done on purpose to ensure that only those authorized to approve legal agreements for the Intersite Program do so, and only those that are authorized to add products to the Common Catalog do so. Make sure you understand your role in the Intersite Program and the user role(s) you have been assigned in <span class="gc_cx_variablesPlatformName3" data-mc-conditions="gc_cx_conditions.cx_external">(Undefined variable: gc_cx_variables.PlatformName3)</span>.</p>
            <p>The following roles are used in the Intersite program:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Product Owner</b> – Simply stated, this is the owner of a product. The person(s) in this role is responsible for listing and pricing products in the Intersite Common Catalog and managing the relationships with Product Sellers. Product Owners should be familiar with the product setup process and understand how their products should be customized (if at all) for the Common Catalog. Product Owners must also decide how they want to approve Product Sellers to sell their products. Product Owners also set the fixed (default) and MSRP for the product in the Common Catalog. These prices determine how much the Product Owner and Product Seller receive when a sale is made.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Product Seller</b> – This is the party that sells an Intersite Program product on their site. Product Sellers are responsible for choosing the products from the Common Catalog that they want to sell on their site. Product Sellers cannot change the details of a product, only the Product Owner can edit the product content. Product Sellers can change the MSRP for a product, as long as the price they set falls between the range limit set by the Product Owner.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Legal Agreement Manager</b> – The person responsible for reviewing and accepting the legal terms and contract for the marketStream Intersite Program, on behalf of the Product Seller company or Product Owner company.
There are different legal agreements for each role in the program (Seller or Owner) and all legal agreements must be accepted before full participation can begin. Once an agreement is accepted an electronic copy will be sent to the email address entered when the contract was accepted. Legal terms only need to be approved once per company. When a contract is accepted it is applied to all sites that are part of the company.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note_error_indent"><b>Warning</b>: The person who approves the legal agreements must be authorized by the Product Seller company or Product Owner company to approve legal contracts. Digital River staff cannot accept legal agreements on behalf of any party in the Intersite Program.</p>
