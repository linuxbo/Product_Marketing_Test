            <p>You must set up the offer and POP combinations for your store before you can create an offer of a specific type. There are also other settings and options you can define for offers such as how you want "shipping order value" offers to behave, whether you want inventory checks for offers that use POPs, and whether you want to warn shoppers that the offer they are using has a usage limit.  </p>

            <p>Shipping order value offers are used to provide a promotion or discount when the total order value reaches or exceeds a certain amount that you set when you create the offer. However, because multiple offers can be applied to the same order you may want to control whether order value offers use the order total calculated before or after any other discounts are applied. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: The <i>Shipping Order Value</i> area will only appear if the Shipping Order Value offer type has been added to your store. See <a href="#offertypesandpops" class="selected">Adding Offer Types and Associating POPs with Offer Types</a> below for instructions on how to add the Shipping Order Value offer type.</p>

            <h2>Setting Product Inventory Check</h2>
            <p>The Product Inventory Check setting is used to indicate whether you want out of stock products to appear in offers. The inventory check does not work with offers that do not discount or apply to a specific product. This means that an offer that discounts an entire order or the shipping costs for an entire order regardless of the products purchased cannot do an inventory check.  The inventory check also does not work with candy rack POPs.</p>
