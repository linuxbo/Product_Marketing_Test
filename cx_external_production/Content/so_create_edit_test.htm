                <MadCap:concept term="Site Optimizer" />Creating Site Optimizer Tests</h1>
            <p>Site Optimizer tests are created using a wizard, which guides you through each step of the creation process. Once you create a test, it cannot be edited and must be ended or retired to stop running on your store. You can only edit Site Optimizer Tests with a status of <i>Pending Start</i>. This is a test with a Start Date that has not yet occurred.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: When a Site Optimizer Test is running, all offers of the same type as the offers in the Site Optimizer test are temporarily suspended. This is so the test can run without interference.</p>
            <p>Before you can create a Site Optimizer Test  you must first create and deploy the marketing offers you want to include in the test. The offers you create must have the offer trigger set as Site Test. Offers with this type of trigger do not become available on your site until you create a Site Optimizer Test that uses them. See <a href="mr_create_edit_offer.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Marketing Offers</b></a> for instructions on creating marketing offers.</p>
            <p>When you create a test, if the Test Type you want is greyed out/unavailable or if you do not see any offers when you create the test cells, it means that there is not an associated marketing offer that can be used with the test. Keep in mind that only certain types of offers can be used with the specific test types. See <a href="so_offer_and_test_types.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>Offer Types and Test Types</b></a> to determine which Test Types are compatible with marketing offer types. </p>
            <h3>Previewing Tests</h3>
            <p>If needed, you can preview a test and see how each of the test cells will appear to a shopper. When you preview a test, you will see a version of your store that uses the first cell in the test. You can then click "Next" and "Previous" in the preview widget to move through the cells in the test. </p>
