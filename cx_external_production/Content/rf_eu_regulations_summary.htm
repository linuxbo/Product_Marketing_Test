            <p>The European Commission (EC) has adopted several directives governing the fair use and end-of-life handling of CE products. These directives aim to control the use of hazardous substances, reduce waste from electrical and electronic equipment, and guarantee the right to duplicate copyright materials with reprography and storage devices. The EC directives have a significant and direct impact on any business that produces, sells, resells, imports, or distributes consumer electronic products within the European Union (EU). </p>
            <h2>Regulations Summary</h2>
            <p>The regulations brought about by the concerns surrounding CE products can be broken down into three groups, with each group addressing specific concerns: recycling, environmental, copyright. The following list shows the specific directives currently in place in the EU to address these concerns.</p>
            <p>Recycling: </p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">2002/96/EC - Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)</li>
                <li value="2">2006/66/EC - Batteries and Accumulators and their Wastes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Environmental:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">2002/95/EC - Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Copyright:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">2001/29/EC - Information Society Directive (also known as the EU Copyright Directive)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recycling (Hardware and Consumer Electronics)</h3>
            <p>Laws regarding the recycling of hardware and consumer electronics were created as mandated by the EC directive 2002/96/EC - Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). </p>
            <p>The aim of this directive is to reduce waste from electrical and electronic equipment (also known as "WEEE"). In summary, this directive encourages recycling, and prevents WEEE from ending up in landfills. This directive holds producers responsible for the handling and recycling of WEEE at the end of the product’s life. To fund these obligations, producers are allowed to charge product fees at the point of sale. These fees are often presented in the shopping carts on e-commerce sites depending on the visibility requirements of each country. </p>
            <h4>Directive Guidelines</h4>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Requires producers/importers that bring electrical and electronic equipment into a market to assume the responsibility for disposing and/or recycling these products at the end of their lifecycle.</li>
                <li value="2">Producers/importers must register with national authorities in the markets in which their CE products will be sold. Registration provides several benefits, such as ability to participate in local recycling compliance schemes, and access to standards for proper product labeling, product fee visibility, and point-of-sale communications on product recycling and disposal. </li>
                <li value="3">Producers/importers may charge a "WEEE fee" in some countries at the point of sale to fund their obligation (and to bring visibility to the issue) but the directive states that "users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of <span class="_Override" style="text-decoration: underline;">returning WEEE at least free of charge</span>."</li>
                <li value="4">Depending on the jurisdiction, WEEE fees must either be integrated into the product price (inclusive) or shown as a separate charge to the consumer (exclusive) when they view the shopping cart.</li>
                <li value="5">WEEE fees must be reported and paid directly to the appropriate compliance scheme.</li>
                <li value="6">Producers/importers that collect electrical and electronic waste (WEEE) must create a way for end-users to return waste equipment for recycling and/or disposal. </li>
                <li value="7">Producers/importers that collect WEEE products are encouraged to dispose of the waste ecologically or reuse/refurbish the waste.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recycling (Batteries)</h3>
            <p>Laws regarding the manufacture and waste management of batteries were created in response to the EC directive 2006/66/EC - Batteries and Accumulators and their Wastes. </p>
            <p>The aim of this directive is to control the metals and chemicals used in the production of batteries and to facilitate and fund recycling and waste management of batteries. In summary, this directive bans certain metal and chemicals in batteries, limits the amount of other metals and chemicals in batteries, and calls for waste management of batteries that includes recycling and "take back" programs. </p>
            <h3>Environmental (RoHS)</h3>
            <p>Laws regarding the use of certain substances in CE products were created in response to the EC directive 2002/95/EC - Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS).</p>
            <p>The aim of this directive is to restrict the use of certain hazardous substance in electronic and electrical equipment. RoHS restricts the use of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium, cadmium and a range of flame retardants notably polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the same standard ten categories of electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) outlined by the WEEE directive.</p>
            <h4>Requirements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Producers may not put electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) containing lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), in amounts exceeding the established maximum concentration values on the EU market.</li>
                <li value="2">Producers must be able to demonstrate compliance by submitting technical documentation or other information to the enforcement authority on request and retain such documentation for a period of four years after the EEE is placed on the market.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Copyright (Reprography and Private Copying)</h3>
            <p>Laws regarding the sale and use of reprography and storage devices were created in response to the EC directive 2001/29/EC - Information Society Directive, also known as the EU Copyright Directive (EUCD) or Information Society Directive (Infosoc). </p>
            <p>The aim of this directive is to limit the use of reprography and storage devices from infringing on copyrights. The following summarizes the basic requirements and rules within the copyright directive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Addresses reprography and private copying obligations impacting reproduction and digital storage devices. The directive "concerns the legal protection of copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, with particular emphasis on the information society."</li>
                <li value="2">Producers (or importers) must collect at the time of purchase (from the purchaser) a prescribed copyright fee for any product required under this directive. </li>
                <li value="3">Fee must be charged for required digital storage or reprography products. Some common examples of products that require this fee: copiers, printers, MP3 players, blank CD or DVD media, etc.</li>
                <li value="4">Copyright fees must be used to compensate copyright holders for the rights to duplicate their print and digital materials. </li>
                <li value="5">Copyright fees must be reported and remitted to copyright cooperatives and distributed to the copyright holders in each country.</li>
            </ul>
