                <MadCap:concept term="Site Optimizer" />How Site Optimizer Works</h1>
            <p>Site Optimizer is a tool you can use to test the performance of marketing events on your store. Using a Site Optimizer test you can track the effectiveness of different pages, offers, pricing schemes, and promotions to determine which method works best with your shoppers to increase revenue.</p>
            <p>Site Optimizer uses the A/B testing method to compare how different marketing approaches work on your store. Shoppers visiting your store are shown a sample in the test (an offer, pricing scheme, store page or content, and so on) and the resulting sales behavior is tracked and recorded. You can then run a report to see how each of the samples in your test performed.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: When a Site Optimizer Test is running, all offers of the same type as the offers in the Site Optimizer test are temporarily suspended. This is so the test can run without interference.</p>
            <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
            <p>A/B testing, also called "split testing" is a testing method that has been used by marketers to test new marketing approaches for many years. In an A/B test, a control sample ("A") is compared against another sample ("B") and the results are tracked. Site Optimizer uses A/B testing because it is metrics-driven, objective, and more efficient than other site optimization techniques. For more about A/B testing, see <a href="so_about_ab_testing.htm" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref"><b>About A/B Testing</b></a>.</p>
            <h2>Champion and Challengers</h2>
            <p>In a Site Optimizer test the control sample is called the "champion," while the sample(s) being compared are called the "challenger(s)." Tests can have multiple challengers but only one champion. </p>
            <p>Control samples are called "champion" because often they are the winner of a previous Site Optimizer test. We recommend that you choose your champion samples from existing marketing offers, campaigns, site/store pages and content and so on. This will allow you to fully test the challengers against a proven approach.</p>
            <h2>Test Cells and the Split</h2>
            <p>When a shopper visits your store, they are randomly shown one of the test samples, also known as a test "cell." The assigned test cell will be shown to the shopper for their entire visit on your store. The only time a new test cell is assigned is when the shopper completes an order or clears their browser cookies.</p>
            <p>When you create a Site Optimizer test, you choose what you want to be shown to the shopper for each test cell (offer, store/site content, and so on). An offer can only be used in one test cell within a single Site Optimizer test but you can use the same offer in multiple tests. </p>
            <p>For tests where offers are being tested, you can have "no offer" assigned to the cell. When a test cell has no offer assigned to it, shoppers who are shown this cell may see other existing offers on your store. You should only leave a test cell empty if you are certain you want shoppers to see competing offers or be shown nothing for the test. </p>
            <p>The number of shoppers that are assigned to each test cell is determined by a percentage that you enter when you create the Site Optimizer test. This percentage is called the "split" because it determines how the challenger and champion cells are split between shoppers on your store.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>:&#160;You can preview a test as if you are a shopper and see how each of the test cells appear to a shopper. </p>
            <h2>How Test Performance is Measured</h2>
            <p>Once a test is created, it will begin running on your store and certain measures of the testâ€™s performance will be tracked and recorded. You can view the progress of a test while it is running, or see the results of an earlier test that has ended</p>

            <p>The following table defines each of the performance metrics that are tracked for each test cell in a Site Optimizer test. Close Ratio, Sales, and Revenue per Visitor are usually the most important metrics for a test because they reflect the actual revenue impact of each test cell. </p>

            <h2><a name="Confiden"></a>Confidence Rating</h2>
            <p>Because there are multiple ways you can interpret the individual metrics within a test, Site Optimizer calculates a "confidence" rating for each cell. The confidence rating is really just a simple way for you to see which cellâ€“ on the wholeâ€“ outperformed the others. The confidence rating is calculated by examining Sales, Close Ratio, and Revenue per Visitor. The cell with the highest confidence rating is deemed as the sample with the possible biggest revenue impact on your store.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Tip</b>: If the Confidence rating for the challenger level(s) is near 0% it means that the champion (control) level is winning the test. </p>
            <h2>Ending Tests</h2>
            <p>After a test has run on your store and you have analyzed the results, you will want to either end the test or keep it running to gather more data. In some cases, you may want to create a new test with one or more of the samples in your current test for further analysis.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;The "end date" you set for a test is only used to indicate when you want the data collection to end. Tests will continue run (with no data being collected) beyond their end date until they are promoted, retired, or manually ended.</p>
            <p>When you end a test, the test cells no longer appear on your store but the test itself still exists and can be restarted at a later time. When you restart a test it is like starting the test anew, that is all data recorded for the test will begin on the restart date.</p>
            <h3>Promoting the Winner</h3>
            <p>If you get strong results from a particular test cell, you can promote that test cell to your store for all shoppers to see. When you promote a test cell, it retires all other test cells and no additional performance data will be collected for the those retired cells. If the promoted cell is a marketing offer, you can run a report using the offer ID to see how that offer is performing.</p>
