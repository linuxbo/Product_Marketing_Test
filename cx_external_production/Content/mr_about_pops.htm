                <MadCap:concept term="Offers;Offers PoPs" />About Points of Promotion (POPs)</h1>
            <p>A point of promotion (POP) is used to display an offer on your store. The offer type you choose determines which POP(s) can be used by an offer (or whether a POP&#160;is even needed) and the POP itself determines when and where the offer and display content for the offer appears on your store. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: The POPs you can select for an offer are determined by the POPs you have <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm#offertypesandpops">associated with the offer in the offer settings</a>. </p>
            <p>POPs have rules about their behavior and what occurs when a shopper encounters the POP (site flow, cart behavior, etc.). For example, cross-sell and up-sell offers can use POPs that show a page between the Product Detail and Shopping Cart pages. The page appears to shoppers when they add a product to their cart from the Product Detail page and allows them to add a cross-sell or up-sell product to their order.</p>
            <p>A POP can be a banner image, home page image, pop-up window, interstitial page, and so on. Most offers will use some type of POP, even if that offer is not created to give a discount or special pricing. In those cases the POP is only used to display advertising and marketing content on select areas of your store. </p>
            <p>Your site has several standard POPs that are associated with the standard set of offer types. Site design can add new POPs for any store. A POP can also be used to display content without a product offer. </p>
            <p>Not every offer uses a POP and not all POPs can be used with any offer. The relationship between offers and POPs is defined by the offer type configuration that is set for the site. </p>
            <h2>Specific Use POPs</h2>
            <p>Some POPs are made for a specific type of offer and must be used or the offer won’t work correctly. For example, when you create a "Cross-sell" offer you must use the "Interstitial_Cross-sell" POP or the shopper won’t see the offer because there will be nowhere to display it. </p>
            <p>Another example of a POP that was created for a specific purpose is the "Featured Items" POP. This POP appears on your store’s home page and shows a set of products you want to feature. Technically there is no limit to the number of products you can include but we recommend you limit your featured products to five products or less.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: To learn more about what POPs are used specifically with different offer types, see <a href="mr_about_offer_types.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>About Offer Types</b></a>.</p>
            <p>POPs have rules about their behavior and what will occur when a shopper encounters an offer that uses a POP. For example, POPs used by "Cross-Sell" and "Up-Sell" offers are actually interstitial pages that appear when the shopper adds a product to shopping cart, thus encouraging the shopper to purchase additional products without redirecting them away from the page.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: POPs are highly customizable and many POPs won’t work as you expect without some set up from the Digital River Site Design team. If your store is new or you have not yet worked with POPs and offers, we recommend you contact your Store Operations team to learn how POPs have been customized for your store. You can also speak with your Store Operations team if you want to get custom POPs created for your store. </p>
