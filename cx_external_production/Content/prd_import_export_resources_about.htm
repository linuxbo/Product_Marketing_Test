                <MadCap:concept term="Resource Files;Images;Importing Resource Files;Zip File for Resources" />About Import and Export Resources</h1>
            <p>You can use the Import and Export Resources feature to export a copy of your resource directory tree or import several resource files at once using a Zip file. Resource files are usually images used for products or categories but they can also be other content you use on your store. Importing resources in a Zip file is a more efficient way to import several images at once.</p>
            <h2>Exporting Your Resource Directory Tree</h2>
            <p>The resource directory tree shows the directory structure of resource files (category and product images) on your site. This file is only meant to be used as a resource and is helpful when building Zip<span class="Superscript">®</span> file of resource images that you want to upload. Please note that you cannot import any changes to the resource directory tree.</p>
            <h2>Importing Resources and Zip Files</h2>
            <p>You can import several resource files (product and category images)&#160;using the Import and&#160;Export Resources feature. To successfully import resource files, you must first create a Zip file with the same directory structure as your resource directory tree and save the resource files in the appropriate folders. If the files are not saved in the correct structure they will not be imported or seen on your store. To learn how you can get a copy of your resource tree for reference, see <b>Importing and Exporting Resources</b>. </p>
            <h3><a name="zip_file"></a>Creating a Zip File for Resources</h3>
            <p>Resource files (product or category images) must be imported using a Zip<sup>®</sup> file. Zip files are created using a program called WinZip<sup>®</sup>. You can learn more about WinZip at <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank">www.winzip.com</a>.</p>
            <p>The folder structure in the Zip file must follow the structure you see in your resource directory tree. See Importing and Exporting Resources to learn how you can export a copy of your resource tree for reference.</p>
            <p>The structure of your resources directory is unique to your store and was set up when your site was created. This structure shows how files and images are organized into folders and saved on your site. The example below shows a sample structure. Keep in mind that your structure will differ from what you see below. </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">To create a Zip file to import images:</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">First, create a folder on your computer with the name of the root folder used to store images, as shown in your resource directory tree (see Importing and Exporting Resources to learn how you can export a copy of your resource tree for reference). Make sure the folder name matches the name in your resource directory tree exactly (spelling and case) or the import will not work as expected. <br /><br />For example, using the image above as a sample, you would create a folder named “images.”</li>
                <li value="2">Now, recreate the directory structure (folders) that are outlined in your exported resource directory tree (see the instructions above to export). Make sure that when you create the folders you use the correct case (as shown in your resource directory tree) and spelling for the folder names. Do not worry about putting images or files in the folders until you have the entire structure created. <br /><br />For example, using the image above as a sample, in the “images” folder you would create a “category” folder, in which you would create a “thumbnail” folder. Then you would create a “product” folder (in the “images” folder) in which you would create a “detail” folder and “thumbnail” folder.</li>
                <li value="3">Once you have created a directory structure on your computer that matches the one in your directory resource tree, copy the images you want to import into the appropriate folder(s) for their type. <br /><br />For example, copy product images into the folder used to hold product detail or thumbnail images and category images into the folder used to hold category images.</li>
                <li value="4">Create a Zip<sup>®</sup> file of the entire directory structure (including the images you just copied) you have created. Refer to the WinZip<sup>®</sup> documentation for help on creating Zip files. Make sure you enable the <i>Save Full Path Info</i> option in WinZip<sup>®</sup>.</li>
                <li value="5">Upload the Zip<sup>®</sup> file using the instructions earlier in this topic.  Make sure you import the file from the <i>Import and Export Resources</i> feature (see Importing and Exporting Resources for more information). This is the only Import and Export feature that allows you to import a Zip file.</li>
            </ol>
