            <p>The "custom bundle" offer type is a unique type of bundle offer where shoppers choose products from various groups you have created within the offer. Depending on the offer setup, shoppers may have to select a certain number of products from a group, some groups may be required, and there may be a minimum or maximum limit on the products they can select. Once the shopper has fulfilled the requirements for the offer they can checkout and complete their purchase. </p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: Make sure you add the custom bundle offer type in offer settings, and associate the "CustomBundle_Eligibility_Promotion" POP&#160;to the custom bundle offer type.</p>
            <h2>Difference Between Custom Bundle and Shopper-Defined Bundle</h2>
            <p>The difference between a custom bundle offer and a shopper-defined bundle is that in a custom bundle you create groups of products from which shoppers can select. In a shopper-defined bundle there is only one group of products and the restrictions and discount options are more limited and apply to all products that are part of the offer. Custom bundles allow you to create different purchasing restrictions and set different discounts for different groups of products in your bundle.</p>
            <h2><a name="ProductGroups"></a>Custom Bundle Product Groups</h2>
            <p>When you create a custom bundle you create groups of products from which a shopper selects what they want to purchase. Depending on your products and how you build the custom bundle, the products could be standalone products or components that a shopper selects to create a larger product. For example, if your store sold computer equipment and supplies you could create a custom bundle that allowed a shopper to choose the computer, monitor, printer, and other accessories they wanted to purchase.</p>
            <p>Custom bundles must contain at least two groups, one of which must be a "mandatory" group. Mandatory groups are ones which a shopper must select product(s) from, and the number of products they must (or can) select are determined by the minimum and maximum quantities you define for the group. You can think of products in a mandatory group like parent products in other bundle offers. </p>
            <p>After you have created the mandatory group (be default the first group you create must be the mandatory group) you can then create additional groups and have them be mandatory or optional. You can also define the minimum number of products a shopper must select and the maximum number of products a shopper can select from each group.  </p>
            <p>There are some restrictions for the number of groups you can create and the number of products that can be in each group. These limits are defined in the <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm#Setting3">custom bundle settings</a>. </p>
            <h2>Custom Bundles and Discounts</h2>
            <p>A custom bundle does not necessarily have to provide a discount. If you want a discount you can set one for each product in a group, use the same discount for all products in the group, or discount the entire bundle.</p>
            <h2>Custom Bundle POP</h2>
            <p>The custom bundle offer type uses a specific point of promotion (POP)&#160;called "CustomBundle_Eligibility_Promotion." This POP must be associated with the custom bundle offer type in the <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm">offer type settings</a> and must be selected when you create the offer or will not appear on your store. </p>
            <p>The custom bundle POP is used to display the custom bundle groups and products in a special window. It also creates a mini-cart that shows what products from the custom bundle the shopper has selected. The mini-cart also shows the discount(s) the shopper will get on their purchase. Shoppers access the special custom bundle window by clicking a link on a Product Detail page or shopping cart. Links to the special window can also appear on the home page or category list page if the appropriate site design work has been done to add them on those pages.</p>
            <h2>Custom Bundles and Offer Arbitration</h2>
            <p>When you have a deployed custom bundle on your store, that offer will always "win" offer arbitration. This means that if the shopper adds one of the products in the "mandatory" group to their cart, it will trigger the offer and the shopper will be presented with the custom bundle</p>
