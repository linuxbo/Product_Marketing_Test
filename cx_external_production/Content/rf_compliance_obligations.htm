                <MadCap:concept term="Regulatory Fees;Fees" /><a name="kanchor15"></a>Compliance Obligations</h1>
            <p>All parties in the supply chain play a role in the compliance of the regulations. Any business that brings products into the European market where regulations are in place is legally responsible for complying with the regulations. Most directives have specific requirements for registration, fee collection (fee values and calculations) point-of-sale display requirements, management and application of fees within a product catalog, and reporting and/or remittance of fees to the appropriate entities. The following roles are involved in regulatory compliance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Producers/Importers</b> – Entity that brings a product into a market.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Retailers and Distributors</b> – Entity that provides logistic support or brings the product to the consumer.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Compliance Schemes</b> – Government-appointed body that manages regulatory compliance for directives in individual markets. Compliance schemes do not manage across multiple countries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>WEEE Directive Requirements</h3>
            <p>The following summarizes the basic requirements and rules within the recycling directive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Requires companies that bring electrical and electronic equipment into a market to assume the responsibility for disposing and/or recycling these products at the end of their lifecycle.</li>
                <li value="2">Companies must register with national authorities in the markets in which their CE products will be sold. Registration provides several benefits, such as ability to participate in local recycling compliance schemes, and access to standards for proper product labeling, product fee visibility, and point-of-sale communications on product recycling and disposal. </li>
                <li value="3">Companies can charge a "WEEE fee" at the point of sale to fund their obligation (and to bring visibility to the issue) but the directive states that "users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of <span class="_Override" style="text-decoration: underline;">returning WEEE at least free of charge</span>."</li>
                <li value="4">WEEE fees can be integrated into the product price (inclusive) or shown as a separate charge (exclusive) to the consumer. </li>
                <li value="5">WEEE fees must be reported and paid directly to the appropriate compliance scheme.</li>
                <li value="6">Companies that collect electrical and electronic waste (WEEE) must create a way for end-users of the equipment to return waste equipment to the manufacturer for recycling and/or disposal. </li>
                <li value="7">Manufacturers that collect WEEE products are encouraged to dispose of the waste ecologically or reuse/refurbish the waste. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compliance Requirements</h4>
            <p>Each directive has different compliance responsibilities for each entity in the supply chain. As the Reseller of Record, Digital River will likely (depending on the jurisdiction) assume each role in the supply chain.</p>

            <h3>Copyright Directive Requirements</h3>
            <p>The following summarizes the basic requirements for the copyright directive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Addresses reprography and private copying obligations impacting reproduction and digital storage devices. The directive "concerns the legal protection of copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, with particular emphasis on the information society."</li>
                <li value="2">Producers/importers are obligated to pay the fees. They can collect fees separately at the time of sale. </li>
                <li value="3">Fees are charged in some markets at the point of sale. Some common examples of products that require this fee: copiers, printers, MP3 players, blank CD or DVD media, etc.</li>
                <li value="4">Copyright fees must be used to compensate copyright holders for the rights to duplicate their print and digital materials. </li>
                <li value="5">Copyright fees must be reported and remitted to copyright compliance schemes who then distribute to the copyright holders in each country.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Compliance Requirements</h4>
            <p>Each directive has different compliance responsibilities for each entity in the supply chain. As the Reseller of Record, Digital River will likely (depending on the jurisdiction) assume each role in the supply chain.</p>

            <h2>Compliance Challenges</h2>
            <p>Compliance with the EC directives and resulting laws is critical to success in the global e-commerce marketplace, however the regulatory fee environment presents several operational, technological, legal, and financial challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Companies must comply with numerous country&#8209;specific laws but the sheer number of laws, inconsistent transition of the EC directives, and variations among the laws makes total compliance difficult.</li>
                <li value="2">Registration procedures, mandatory product fees, recycling and compliance schemes, and reporting and payment requirements vary from country to country and sometimes even product to product making it difficult to keep track of each obligation.</li>
                <li value="3">Because compliance is the obligation of the party that brings the product "to market" there is confusion surrounding who is obligated for products that work their way through the supply chain.</li>
                <li value="4">Pricing models and long-term business goals can be affected and subsequently altered to accommodate requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Digital River has developed a comprehensive fee management solution within our robust commerce platform. Our regulatory management approach begins with a dedicated fee management team that understands the EC directives and resulting laws, and ends with a fee management tool that is flexible enough to meet the requirements for each country in Europe. </p>
