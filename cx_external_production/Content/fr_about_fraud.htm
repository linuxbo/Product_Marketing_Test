                <MadCap:concept term="Fraud" /><a name="kanchor76"></a>About Fraud</h1>
            <p>The Internet has become a major vehicle for fraud against online merchants. Online purchases are, by nature, CNP ("card not present") transactions—merchants cannot inspect cards physically to verify their authenticity. Cyber criminals use highly sophisticated methods to retrieve and compromise account and personal information from unsuspecting online users to engage in the illegal and costly pursuit of e-commerce fraud.</p>
            <p>Digital River’s fraud prevention and investigations teams provide risk mitigation solutions through patented technologies, localized expertise, and an innovative, proprietary fraud index measurement technique. Digital River’s industry-leading experts and systems present a highly efficient and cost effective solution to protect online merchants from the risks of online fraud.</p>
            <h2>How Digital River Identifies Fraud</h2>
            <p>Our fraud system uses 13 common fraud prevention tools to provide a comprehensive, adjustable, best-of-breed fraud prevention approach. If your store needs additional tools or technology to help minimize loss for high-risk products we can also provide that. Some examples of these customized solutions include voice authorization, age verification solutions for restricted products, and individual authentication. </p>
            <p>The following outlines the 13 tools our Fraud team uses to help reduce fraud on your store:</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1"><b>Address Validation</b> – Digital River uses the credit card association Address Validation System (AVS), as well as other third-party tools, to verify addresses populated into orders. Precautions are taken to ensure that false positive fraud identifications (otherwise known as insults) are minimized. Invalid addresses or addresses that do not appear logical, based on order details, are treated with extra scrutiny as they are strong indicators that fraud may be occurring.</li>
                <li value="2"><b>Card Verification Code (CVC)</b> – The card verification code is the three-or-four-digit number displayed on the back of a credit card. Verifying the code helps ensure that the person placing the order has physical possession of the card. A missing or mismatched CVC can be an effective fraud indicator. Nevertheless, total reliance on the CVCs is not advisable as typing errors can lead to false positives.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Fraud Assessment Customization</b> – Because Digital River’s 40,000 clients represent a wide variety of product categories, price points, and risk profiles, we provide customizable fraud prevention rules and logic flows. We classify business segments into risk buckets, which are generalized and applied to specific methodologies and technologies to maximize a company’s approach to the fraud prevention lifecycle.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>IP Geo-Location</b> – The IP Geo-Location tool traces an IP address to the originating locale or region and compares this data to the transaction being processed. The location tool helps identify cyber criminals in remote locations who may be isolated from the law. For example, the tool can trace a transaction to Egypt and compare it to the entered billing address that may say Arizona, indicating a potentially suspicious transaction.</li>
                <li value="5"><b>Negative Lists</b> – Negative Lists is a critical tracking tool designed to ensure that the same set of data is not used to perpetrate fraud more than once. Digital River uses an extensive negative file process that includes numerous fields of information from the tainted transaction. This process is coupled with checks and balances that allow legitimate customers to continue making purchases while optimizing the ability to capture fraud.</li>
                <li value="6"><b>Velocity Checking</b> – Velocity Checking is key to minimizing losses and detecting more subtle fraud attempts. Our system of heuristic fraud-attempt-indicators heightens fraud detection and allows for sophisticated assessment of the data available through e-commerce transactions. In conjunction with straight velocity checking, extra heuristic analysis dimensions include: order attempts data, unusual navigation patterns on a Web page, service look-ups, and fraud team feedback. This additional data gives Digital River deeper insights into e-commerce transactions and significantly improves a company’s chances of detecting even subtle fraudulent activity.</li>
                <li value="7"><b>3-D Secure</b> – 3-D Security is an advanced technique prompting customers to create a password that can be verified during the online ordering process. Adoption of 3-D Secure has increased as merchants and consumers grow comfortable with the process. Digital River uses 3-D Secure with high-risk clients and product lines to optimize the entire fraud prevention lifecycle.</li>
                <li value="8"><b>Industry Research/Participation</b> – Digital River participates in the Merchant Risk Council (MRC) industry consortium to learn more about common industry models specifically for digital delivery merchants, as well as to learn about new threats, in order to combat these threats in an agile fashion.</li>
                <li value="9"><b>Chargeback Prevention/Feedback Tools</b> – Inevitably, some fraudulent transactions evade fraud controls and become chargebacks. It is critical to combat and limit the extent of new, more sophisticated fraud attacks by quickly feeding this new data back into the rules engine and to analysts manually reviewing orders. Digital River is committed to training its team members, monitoring chargeback patterns, and maintaining its agility in performing investigations.</li>
                <li value="10"><b>Positive Lists</b> – It is important to have stringent and consistent fraud prevention techniques. At the same time, it is essential to ensure that legitimate customers are not rejected by the system. Maintaining positive lists and data sets allows Digital River to make detailed adjustments for specific lines of business, as necessary.</li>
                <li value="11"><b>Electronic Case Management System</b> – Digital River’s fraud prevention specialists use a Case Management System that successfully tracks and identifies fraud patterns and new attacks. By manually and automatically linking data from order attempts, accepted orders, and chargebacks, Digital River’s team determines emerging patterns and generates fraud rules and models based on the patterns identified. A concise, graphically rich, standard user interface helps Digital River’s team leverage their expert pattern recognition skills.</li>
                <li value="12"><b>"Out-Of-Wallet" Challenge Questions</b> – For higher-risk clients and product lines, Digital River can present “Out-Of-Wallet” questions during the ordering process, which create another level of validation. Responses to these questions are used during the fraud prevention assessment to determine if the transaction should be rejected, manually reviewed, or accepted. ”Out of Wallet” challenge questions can be simple or complex based on merchants’ business requirements.</li>
                <li value="13"><b>PC/Device Fingerprinting</b> – Many fraud rings leverage a set of machines and inexpensive labor to wield wide attacks on hundreds of Web stores at a time. While the machines are a constant, the data entered by the people employed by cyber criminals is ever changing. When numerous points of detailed data are regularly changed, it can become extremely difficult to detect fraud. Digital River uses PC/Device Fingerprinting to apply a vast array of Internet and browser session variables to pinpoint a machine and tag it with an identifier. Once a machine or set of machines has been identified, many of the tools described above can be extended to incorporate PC / Device Fingerprinting in order to shut down the machines performing an attack.</li>
