                <MadCap:concept term="Offers Custom Bundles" />Creating Custom&#160;Bundle Offers</h1>
            <p>A custom bundle offer is one where the shopper can select from groups of products to create a bundle offer on your store. </p>
            <p>Creating a custom bundle is very similar to creating other types of offers and <a href="mr_create_choosing_other_settings.htm">many of the settings</a> you can set for other offer types are the same for custom bundles. Because the process to create a custom bundle is very similar to other offers, this topic focuses on creating the <a href="mr_about_bundle_offers_custom_bundles.htm#ProductGroups">groups</a> for a custom bundle and entering the Display Content for the custom bundle.</p>
            <p class="note_note"><b>Note</b>: To learn how to create an offer, see <a href="mr_create_edit_offer.htm" class="MCXref xref"><b>Creating Marketing Offers</b></a>. When you get to the third step (the <i>Products and Pricing</i> step) or the fourth step (the <i>Display Content</i> step) of the wizard, return to this topic for more detailed instructions.</p>
            <h2>Creating Groups in a Custom Bundle </h2>
            <p>Groups are created in the third step (the <i>Products and Pricing</i> step) of the offer wizard. An example of this step is shown below. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/custom_bundle1_734x992.jpg" style="width: 734;height: 992;" />
            </p>
            <h3>Setting the Currency</h3>
            <p>The <b>Currency</b> list at the top (in the <i>Pricing Information</i> area) is where you select the currency you want to be used for the offer. This is the currency that will be used to calculate the discount (if the offer provides one)&#160;and convert that discount into other currencies. We recommend you select the currency that is the default for the price list used by the products you will add to the offer.</p>
            <h3>Setting the Discount Type</h3>
            <p>The <i>Discount Information</i> area only appears if you chose "bundle" for the <i><a href="mr_create_edit_offer.htm#DiscountLevel">Discount Level setting in the previous step</a></i> of the wizard. When discount an offer at the bundle level it means that the discount will apply to the entire bundle, rather than individual products in the bundle.</p>
            <p>For the <b>Discount Type</b> option, select how you want to discount the bundle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Select <b>No Discount</b> if you do not want to provide a discount with the offer. Custom bundle offers that do not provide a discount (and are "<a href="mr_about_offer_triggers_always_triggered.htm">always triggered</a>" can be used to require a shopper purchase multiple products together, rather than separately.</li>
                <li value="2">Select <b>Amount Off</b> if you want to discount the total cost of the bundle by a specific amount. The amount you enter in the <b>Discount</b> field will be deducted from the cost of the bundle using the currency you selected in the <i>Pricing Information</i> area above. For example, if you set the currency for the offer as USD (United States dollar) and the offer is redeemed by a shopper in EUR (euros), the discount amount will be calculated using the USD to EUR conversion rate, and that discount amount will then be deducted from the cost of the bundle.<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/custom_bundle2_611x127.jpg" style="width: 611;height: 127;" /></li>
                <li value="3">Select <b>Percent Off</b> if you want to discount the total cost of the bundle by a percentage of the cost. The percentage you enter in the <b>Discount</b> field will be deducted from the total cost of the bundle. With the percent off discount type, the currency is not a factor (meaning that if you enter a percent off discount, the price will always be discounted by that percent regardless of currency).<br /><br /><img src="Resources/Images/custom_bundle3_616x133.jpg" style="width: 616;height: 133;" /></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Creating Groups</h3>
            <p>By default, when you get to the <i>Products and Pricing</i> step a group called "Primary Group" is already created and set as "mandatory."&#160;This is because you must have at least one mandatory group for the custom bundle. Once you define and save the first group, you can create additional groups and have them be mandatory or optional as needed. </p>
            <p>An example of what you will see when you first enter this step is below.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/custom_bundle4_687x592.jpg" style="width: 687;height: 592;" />
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">(Optional) In the <b>Group Name</b> field, enter a new name for the group. This name is only used in the Command Console to identify the group.  In a later step (the <a href="#Entering" class="selected">Display Content</a> step) you will enter a name for the group that shoppers will see on the store.</li>
                <li value="2">If you want the shopper to have to buy more than one product from the group, in the <b>Shopper Must Buy at Least</b> field, enter the number of products you want the shopper to have to buy.&#160;<ul><li class="disc" value="1">The number you enter here will be the number of products that the shopper must buy because the first group is mandatory. When you are creating optional groups this minimum is only enforced if the shopper chooses products from the group. </li><li class="disc" value="2">This number cannot be higher than the total number of products you add to the group.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="3">In the <b>Shopper Can Buy at Most</b> field, enter the maximum number of products you want the shopper to be able to purchase (or have to purchase) from the group. <ol><li class="disc" value="1">This number cannot be higher than the total number of products you add to the group.</li></ol></li>
                <li value="4">In the <b>Product Eligibility</b> area, define how you want to define the products for the group:<ul><li value="1">Select <b>Specific Products</b> if you want to add products in different categories or you just want to add a few products from a single category.</li><li value="2">Select <b>Specific Categories</b> if you want to add an entire category of products. Keep in mind there is a limit on the number of products you can add to group as defined in the <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm#Setting3">custom bundle settings</a> so if the categories you select have a total number of products more than this setting you will not be able to add those categories to the group.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="5">In the <i>Products</i> or <i>Categories</i> area (the name varies by the option you selected above), click <b>Add</b>. The <i>Find Products</i> or <i>Find Categories</i> window appears. Search for (and then select)&#160;the products or categories you want to add to the group. Keep in mind there is a limit on the number of products you can add to a group as define in the <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm#Setting3">custom bundle settings</a>. If you select more than this limit you will not be able to save the group.</li>
                <li value="6">Once you have defined the group and added products to the group, click&#160;<b>Save</b>. </li>
                <li value="7">Click <b>Add Group</b> and repeat the steps above to create additional groups for the offer. Keep in mind you must create at least two groups for custom bundle offers, and the number of groups you can create (and the number of products that are in each group) are determined by the <a href="mr_configure_offer_types.htm#Setting3">custom bundle settings</a>.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2><a name="Entering"></a>Entering the Display Content</h2>
            <p>The fourth step of the wizard is the Display Content step. This is where you enter the display names that the shopper will see for each of the groups you have created (as well as the "<a href="mr_about_offer_description_in_cart.htm">offer description in cart</a>"). </p>
            <p>First, in the <b>Offer Description in Cart</b> field, enter the text that you want to appear in the cart when this offer is triggered. You do not have to enter a description if you want nothing to appear.&#160;Repeat this for any additional locales you have selected for the offer (click the locale tabs at top to switch between locales).</p>
            <p>
                <img src="Resources/Images/custom_bundle5_710x169.jpg" style="width: 710;height: 169;" />
            </p>
            <p>In the <i>Storefront Display</i> area, in the <b>Display Name</b> fields for each of the groups you have created, enter what you want to appear to shoppers when they are viewing the groups and products in the offer. </p>
            <p>The name(s) you enter appear on the store with the group. In the example below you can see that we entered a "name" that actually helps direct the shopper on what to do. We recommend you enter a name that will inform your shoppers about the products in the group and any restrictions you have on the number of products they can select. </p>
            <p>The <b>Description</b> you enter will <u>not</u> appear to shoppers and can be used to help others who see this offer later identify the contents of the group.</p>
